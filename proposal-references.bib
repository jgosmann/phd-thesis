  abstract = {The dynamics of autocorrelation associative memory is examined, and a novel neural dynamics which greatly enhances the ability of associative neural networks is presented. This dynamics is such that the output of some particular neurons is reversed (for a discrete model) or the output function is not sigmoid but nonmonotonic (for an analog model). It is also shown by numerical experiments that most of the problems of the conventional model are overcome by the improved dynamics. These results are important not only for practical purposes but also for understanding dynamical properties of associative neural networks.},

Recent theoretical models have converged on a particular account, based on transient associations between independent item and context representations. In the present article, the authors present an alternative model, according to which sequence information is encoded through sustained patterns of activation within a recurrent neural network architecture. As demonstrated through a series of computer simulations, the model provides a parsimonious account for numerous benchmark characteristics of immediate serial recall, including data that have been considered to preclude the application of recurrent neural networks in this domain. Unlike most competing accounts, the model deals naturally with findings concerning the role of background knowledge in serial recall and makes contact with relevant neuroscientific data. Furthermore, the model gives rise to numerous testable predictions that differentiate it from competing theories. Taken together, the results presented indicate that recurrent neural networks may offer a useful framework for understanding short-term memory for serial order.},

The role of this system is only temporary, however, as indicated by the fact that, after damage to the medial temporal lobe, recent memories are impaired but very remote memories are intact. Here we review the evidence that the medial temporal lobe memory system is involved in a process of consolidation: memories are initially dependent on this system but gradually become established in other areas of the brain. We then review some of the ideas that have been proposed about the phenomenon of consolidation and suggest a synthesis of these views. Finally, we describe a simple neural network model that captures some key features of consolidation.},

The model assumes storage of separate episodic images for different words, each image consisting of a vector of feature values. Each image is an incomplete and error prone copy of the studied vector. For the simplest case, it is possible to calculate the probability that a test item is “old,” and it is assumed that a default “old” response is given if this probability is greater than .5. It is demonstrated that this model and its more complete and realistic versions produce excellent qualitative predictions.},

  abstract = {Free recall and recognition are simulated in a network model of the hippocampal formation, incorporating simplified simulations of neurons, synaptic connections, and the effects of acetylcholine. Simulations focus on modeling the effects of the acetylcholine receptor blocker scopolamine on human memory. Systemic administration of scopolamine is modeled by blockade of the cellular effects of acetylcholine in the model, resulting in memory impairments replicating data from studies on human subjects. This blockade of cholinergic effects impairs the encoding of new input patterns (as measured by delayed free recall), but does not impair the delayed free recall of input patterns learned before the blockade. The impairment is selective to the free recall but not the recognition of items encoded under the influence of scopolamine. In the model, scopolamine blocks strengthening of recurrent connections in region CA3 to form attractor states for new items (encoding impaired) but allows recurrent excitation to drive the network into previously stored attractor states (retrieval spared). Neuron populations representing items (individual words) have weaker recurrent connections than neuron populations representing experimental context. When scopolamine further weakens the strength of recurrent connections it selectively prevents the subsequent reactivation of item attractor states by context input (impaired free recall) without impairing the subsequent reactivation of context attractor states by item input (spared recognition). This asymmetry in the strength of attractor states also allows simulation of the list-strength effect for free recall but not recognition. Simulation of a paired associate learning paradigm predicts that scopolamine should greatly enhance proactive interference due to retrieval of previously encoded associations during storage of new associations.},

It is assumed that an attentional filter is constructed by the S. When reaction times can be interpreted as showing an "exhaustive scan" of the learned list, the form taken by the filter is assumed to be an "interactive memory." An interactive memory is the vector sum of vectors of high dimensionality representing the items on the learned list. It is assumed that attentional mechanisms program a set of elements (perhaps neurons or groups of neurons) with the interactive memory, and when a test item is presented, the interactive memory and the input to the set of elements are multiplied together at the elemental level. The elementary outputs are led to a "summer" operating at a fixed rate. By assuming that the S operates so as to keep his output signal-to-noise ratio approximately constant, a simple formula for reaction time can be derived. This formula gives results in good quantitative agreement with 3 sets of experimental data, as well as accounting qualitatively for other experimental results. (30 ref)},

Where there is precise stimulus control and detailed quantitative data, this model reproduces the quantitative behavioral results. Underlying the model is a recoding conjecture of hippocampal computational function. The expanded conjecture includes a special role for randomization and, as recoding progresses with experience, the occurrence of sequence learning and sequence compression. These functions support the putative higher-order hippocampal function, i.e. production of representations readable by a linear decoder and suitable for both neocortical storage and forecasting. Simulations confirm the critical importance of randomly driven recoding and the neurocognitive relevance of sequence learning and compression. Two forms of sequence compression exist, on-line and off-line compression: both are conjectured to support neocortical encoding of context and declarative memory as described by Cohen and Eichenbaum (1993).},

In a new model of short-term memory, the Start-End Model (SEM), the positions of items in a sequence are coded relative to the start and end of that sequence. Simulations confirm SEM's ability to capture the main phenomena in serial recall, such as the effects of primacy, recency, list length, grouping, modality, redundant suffices, proactive interference, retention interval, and phonological similarity. Moreover, SEM is the first model to capture the complete pattern of errors, including transpositions, repetitions, omissions, intrusions, confusions, and, in particular, positional errors between groups and between trials. Unlike other positional models however, SEM predicts that positional errors will maintain relative rather than absolute position, in agreement with recent experiments (Henson, 1977).},

One of its aims was to explore mechanisms for the storage of serial order information in the articulatory loop. Information is represented locally, learning is by “one-shot” Hebbian adjustment of weighted connections, corresponding to item-item and item-context associations, which decay with time. Items are modeled at the level of phonemes and phonemic output is fed back to the next phonemic input. At recall, items are selected serially by “competitive queuing.” Noisy activation values are used, resulting in errors during recall. Simulations of recall showed good agreement with human performance with respect to memory span, phonemic similarity, word length, and patterns of error. There was good but incomplete agreement on the shape of the serial position curve and on the effects of articulatory suppression. A simple modification is shown to produce the correct serial position curve. However, the model was unable to simulate human memory for sequences containing mixtures of phonemically similar and dissimilar items. A suggested modification which retains the central idea of using competitive queuing to select among noisy activation values is described.},

  abstract = {A new model of immediate serial recall is presented: the primacy model. The primacy model stores order information by means of the assumption that the strength of activation of successive list items decreases across list position to form a primacy gradient. Ordered recall is supported by a repeated cycle of operations involving a noisy choice of the most active item followed by suppression of the chosen item. Word-length and list-length effects are attributed to a decay process that occurs both during input when effective rehearsal is prevented, and during output. The phonological similarity effect is attributed to a second stage of processing at which phonological confusions occur. The primacy model produces accurate simulations of the effects of word length, list length, and phonological similarity.},

  abstract = {Summary
We have suggested that it can as a practical matter be useful to regard recall as a search through memory and consider how a data-processor might be programmed to find the desired response. A demonstration experiment in which recall was examined by what might be called the “method of the missing item” was discussed to point out that a process of searching and testing may reasonably be assumed to intervene between memory and overt response.

Two examples were given to illustrate the suggestion that this point of view can be helpful. The first was an experiment on immediate recall of six items presented two at a time, one to one ear and one to the other, at the rate of one item per ear every half-second. Each pair of items that were presented together consisted of a word and a digit, and the side on which the word was presented varied haphazardly from pair to pair. Recall was more successful when S was instructed to report the items of one type and then the items of the other type than when he was instructed to report the items heard on one side and then those heard on the other. The conclusion was that Broadbent's discovery about the preferred order of recall should not be ascribed to an inability to shift attention rapidly from ear to ear; the task is better described as a problem of data-retrieval.

The second example was an experiment on an unconventional question that arises when recall is viewed as a search by a data-processor: may items in memory be assumed to carry time-tags that the processor can examine to determine which occurred more recently? The S received a long series of words, alternately seeing new words and judging which of two he had seen more recently. An equal-discriminability scale of recency in a series of concrete nouns was constructed and was compared with a similar scale for a series of abstract words.},

The chunking model extended the basic convolution–correlation formalism by using multiple convolutions, n-grams (multiple autoassociations of sums of item vectors), and chunks (sums of n-grams) to account for chunking and serial organization. TODAM2 extends the chunking model by including rn-grams (reduced n-grams), labels, and "lebals" (the involution or mirror image of a label) to provide a general model for episodic memory. For paired associates, it is assumed that Ss store only labeled n-grams and lebaled rn-grams. It is shown that the model is broadly consistent with a number of major empirical paired-associate and serial-order effects.},

This theory is based on the Adaptive Character of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) production system (J. R. Anderson, 1993). It assumes that serial lists are represented as hierarchical structures consisting of groups and items within groups. Declarative knowledge units encode the position of items and of groups within larger groups. Production rules use this positional information to organize the serial recall of a list of items. In ACT-R, memory access depends on a limited-capacity activation process, and errors can occur in the contents of recall because of a partial matching process. These limitations conspire in a number of ways to produce the limitations in immediate memory span. As the span increases, activation must be divided among more elements, activation decays more with longer recall times, and there are more opportunities for positional and acoustic confusions. The theory is shown to be capable of predicting both latency and error patterns in serial recall. It addresses effects of serial position, list length, delay, word length, positional confusion, acoustic confusion, and articulatory suppression.},

We show how experience can retune feature detectors to respond to a prescribed convex set of spatial patterns. In particular, the detectors automatically respond to average features chosen from the set even if the average features have never been experienced. Using this procedure, any set of arbitrary spatial patterns can be recoded, or transformed, into any other spatial patterns (universal recoding), if there are sufficiently many cells in the network's cortex. The network is built from short term memory (STM) and long term memory (LTM) mechanisms, including mechanisms of adaptation, filtering, contrast enhancement, tuning, and nonspecific arousal. These mechanisms capture some experimental properties of plasticity in the kitten visual cortex. The model also suggests a classification of adult feature detector properties in terms of a small number of functional principles. In particular, experiments on retinal dynamics, including amarcrine cell function, are suggested.},

A quantitative computer simulation of SAM was developed and applied to the part-list cuing paradigm.

There are, however, a number of phenomena that are not readily captured by the original model. These are outlined here and a fourth component to the model, the episodic buffer, is proposed. It comprises a limited capacity system that provides temporary storage of information held in a multimodal code, which is capable of binding information from the subsidiary systems, and from long-term memory, into a unitary episodic representation. Conscious awareness is assumed to be the principal mode of retrieval from the buffer. The revised model differs from the old principally in focussing attention on the processes of integrating information, rather than on the isolation of the subsystems. In doing so, it provides a better basis for tackling the more complex aspects of executive control in working memory.},

  abstract = {The change detection task has become a standard method for estimating the storage capacity of visual working memory. Most researchers assume that this task isolates the properties of an active short-term storage system that can be dissociated from long-term memory systems. However, long-term memory storage may influence performance on this task. In particular, memory traces from previous trials may create proactive interference that sometimes leads to errors, thereby reducing estimated capacity. Consequently, the capacity of visual working memory may be higher than is usually thought, and correlations between capacity and other measures of cognition may reflect individual differences in proactive interference rather than individual differences in the capacity of the short-term storage system. Indeed, previous research has shown that change detection performance can be influenced by proactive interference under some conditions. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the canonical version of the change detection task – in which the to-be-remembered information consists of simple, briefly presented features – is influenced by proactive interference. Two experiments were conducted using methods that ordinarily produce substantial evidence of proactive interference, but no proactive interference was observed. Thus, the canonical version of the change detection task can be used to assess visual working memory capacity with no meaningful influence of proactive interference.},

Special cases of the model match a classical diffusion process, but leakage and competition work together to address several challenges to existing diffusion, random walk, and accumulator models. The model accounts for data from choice tasks using both time-controlled (e.g., response signal) and standard reaction time paradigms and its adequacy compares favorably with other approaches. A new paradigm that controls the time of arrival of information supporting different choice alternatives provides further support. The model captures choice behavior regardless of the number of alternatives, accounting for the log-linear relation between reaction time and number of alternatives (Hick's law) and explains a complex pattern of visual and contextual priming in visual word identification.},

Based on electrophysiological studies in animals, synchronous sleep oscillations have been long proposed as possible origins of sleep-related memory improvement. Nevertheless, no studies to date have directly investigated the impact of sleep oscillations on overnight memory retention in humans. In the present study we provide evidence that overnight verbal memory retention is highly correlated with the number of sleep spindles detected by an automatic algorithm over left frontocentral areas. At the same time, overnight retention of newly learned faces was found to be independent of spindle activity but correlated with non-rapid-eye-movement sleep time. The data strongly support theories suggesting a link between sleep spindle activity and verbal memory consolidation.},

More recently, sleep stage 2 with sleep spindles as a most prominent feature has received increasing attention. Specifically, in rats hippocampal ripples were found to occur in temporal proximity to cortical sleep spindles, indicating an information transfer between the hippocampus and neocortex, which is supposed to underlie the consolidation of declarative memories during sleep. This study in humans looks at the changes in EEG activity during nocturnal sleep after extensive training on a declarative learning task, as compared with a nonlearning control task of equal visual stimulation and subjectively rated cognitive strain. Time spent in each sleep stage, spindle density, and EEG power spectra for 28 electrode locations were determined. During sleep after training, the density of sleep spindles was significantly higher after the learning task as compared with the nonlearning control task. This effect was largest during the first 90 min of sleep (p \ensuremath{<} 0.01). Additionally, spindle density was correlated to recall performance both before and after sleep (r = 0.56; p \ensuremath{<} 0.05). Power spectra and time spent in sleep stages did not differ between learning and nonlearning conditions. Results indicate that spindle activity during non-REM sleep is sensitive to previous learning experience.},

Behavioral studies suggest that sleep preferentially consolidates explicit aspects of these memories, which during encoding are possibly associated with activation in prefrontal–hippocampal circuitry. Hippocampus-dependent declarative memory benefits particularly from slow-wave sleep (SWS), whereas rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep seems to benefit procedural aspects of memory. Consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memories relies on a dialog between the neocortex and hippocampus. Crucial features of this dialog are the neuronal reactivation of new memories in the hippocampus during SWS, which stimulates the redistribution of memory representations to neocortical networks; and the neocortical slow (\ensuremath{<}1 Hz) oscillation that synchronizes hippocampal-to-neocortical information transfer to activity in other brain structures.},

  abstract = {Despite the ubiquity of sleep across phylogeny, its function remains elusive. In this review, we consider one compelling candidate: brain plasticity associated with memory processing. Focusing largely on hippocampus-dependent memory in rodents and humans, we describe molecular, cellular, network, whole-brain and behavioral evidence establishing a role for sleep both in preparation for initial memory encoding, and in the subsequent offline consolidation of memory. Sleep and sleep deprivation bidirectionally alter molecular signaling pathways that regulate synaptic strength and control plasticity-related gene transcription and protein translation. At the cellular level, sleep deprivation impairs cellular excitability necessary for inducing synaptic potentiation and accelerates the decay of long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity. In contrast, rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep enhance previously induced synaptic potentiation, although synaptic de-potentiation during sleep has also been observed. Beyond single cell dynamics, large-scale cell ensembles express coordinated replay of prior learning-related firing patterns during subsequent NREM sleep. At the whole-brain level, somewhat analogous learning-associated hippocampal (re)activation during NREM sleep has been reported in humans. Moreover, the same cortical NREM oscillations associated with replay in rodents also promote human hippocampal memory consolidation, and this process can be manipulated using exogenous reactivation cues during sleep. Mirroring molecular findings in rodents, specific NREM sleep oscillations before encoding refresh human hippocampal learning capacity, while deprivation of sleep conversely impairs subsequent hippocampal activity and associated encoding. Together, these cross-descriptive level findings demonstrate that the unique neurobiology of sleep exerts powerful effects on molecular, cellular and network mechanisms of plasticity that govern both initial learning and subsequent long-term memory consolidation.},

The sleep spindle is an event in the electroencephalogram (EEG) characterizing Stage 2 sleep. Sleep spindles may reflect, at the electrophysiological level, an ideal mechanism for inducing long-term synaptic changes in the neocortex. Recent evidence suggests the spindle is highly correlated with tests of intellectual ability (e.g.; IQ tests) and may serve as a physiological index of intelligence. Further, spindles increase in number and duration in sleep following new learning and are correlated with performance improvements. Spindle density and sigma (14–16 Hz) spectral power have been found to be positively correlated with performance following a daytime nap, and animal studies suggest the spindle is involved in a hippocampal–neocortical dialogue necessary for memory consolidation. The findings reviewed here collectively provide a compelling body of evidence that the function of the sleep spindle is related to intellectual ability and memory consolidation.},

Here, we investigate the impact of sleep physiology on characteristics of episodic memory using an item- (memory elements) and context- (contextual details associated with those elements) learning paradigm; the latter being especially dependent on the hippocampus. Following back-to-back encoding of two word lists, each associated with a different context, participants were assigned to either a Nap-group, who obtained a 120-min nap, or a No Nap-group. Six hours post-encoding, participants performed a recognition test involving item-memory and context-memory judgments. In contrast to item-memory, which demonstrated no between-group differences, a significant benefit in context-memory developed in the Nap-group, the extent of which correlated both with the amount of stage-2 NREM sleep and frontal fast sleep-spindles. Furthermore, a difference was observed on the basis of word-list order, with the sleep benefit and associated physiological correlations being selective for the second word-list, learned last (most proximal to sleep). These findings suggest that sleep may preferentially benefit contextual (hippocampal-dependent) aspects of memory, supported by sleep-spindle oscillations, and that the temporal order of initial learning differentially determines subsequent offline consolidation.},

We suggest that these two kinds of consolidation, which are ordinarily treated separately, overlap in time and jointly benefit from a period of reduced interference (during which no new memories are formed). Conditions that result in reduced interference include slow wave sleep (SWS), NMDA receptor antagonists, benzodiazepines, alcohol and acetylcholine antagonists. We hypothesize that the consolidation of hippocampal-dependent memories might not depend on SWS per se. Instead, the brain opportunistically consolidates previously encoded memories whenever the hippocampus is not otherwise occupied by the task of encoding new memories.},

Through specific patterns of neuromodulatory activity and electric field potential oscillations, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep support system consolidation and synaptic consolidation, respectively. During SWS, slow oscillations, spindles and ripples — at minimum cholinergic activity — coordinate the re-activation and redistribution of hippocampus-dependent memories to neocortical sites, whereas during REM sleep, local increases in plasticity-related immediate-early gene activity — at high cholinergic and theta activity — might favour the subsequent synaptic consolidation of memories in the cortex.},

In the hippocampus, slow-wave sleep (SWS) is marked by high-frequency network oscillations (∼200 Hz “ripples”), whereas neocortical SWS activity is organized into low-frequency delta (1–4 Hz) and spindle (7–14 Hz) oscillations. While these types of hippocampal and cortical oscillations have been studied extensively in isolation, the relationships between them remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate the existence of temporal correlations between hippocampal ripples and cortical spindles that are also reflected in the correlated activity of single neurons within these brain structures. Spindle–ripple episodes may thus constitute an important mechanism of cortico-hippocampal communication during sleep. This coactivation of hippocampal and neocortical pathways may be important for the process of memory consolidation, during which memories are gradually translated from short-term hippocampal to longer-term neocortical stores.},

  abstract = {Research in the neurosciences continues to provide evidence that sleep plays a role in the processes of learning and memory. There is less of a consensus, however, regarding the precise stages of memory development during which sleep is considered a requirement, simply favorable, or not important. This article begins with an overview of recent studies regarding sleep and learning, predominantly in the procedural memory domain, and is measured against our current understanding of the mechanisms that govern memory formation. Based on these considerations, I offer a new neurocognitive framework of procedural learning, consisting first of acquisition, followed by two specific stages of consolidation, one involving a process of stabilization, the other involving enhancement, whereby delayed learning occurs. Psychophysiological evidence indicates that initial acquisition does not rely fundamentally on sleep. This also appears to be true for the stabilization phase of consolidation, with durable representations, resistant to interference, clearly developing in a successful manner during time awake (or just time, per se). In contrast, the consolidation stage, resulting in additional/enhanced learning in the absence of further rehearsal, does appear to rely on the process of sleep, with evidence for specific sleep-stage dependencies across the procedural domain. Evaluations at a molecular, cellular, and systems level currently offer several sleep specific candidates that could play a role in sleep-dependent learning. These include the upregulation of select plasticity-associated genes, increased protein synthesis, changes in neurotransmitter concentration, and specific electrical events in neuronal networks that modulate synaptic potentiation.},

  abstract = {The brain does not retain all the information it encodes in a day. Much is forgotten, and of those memories retained, their subsequent evolution can follow any of a number of pathways. Emerging data makes clear that sleep is a compelling candidate for performing many of these operations. But how does the sleeping brain know which information to preserve and which to forget? What should sleep do with that information it chooses to keep? For information that is retained, sleep can integrate it into existing memory networks, look for common patterns and distill overarching rules, or simply stabilize and strengthen the memory exactly as it was learned. We suggest such 'memory triage' lies at the heart of a sleep-dependent memory processing system that selects new information, in a discriminatory manner, and assimilates it into the brain's vast armamentarium of evolving knowledge, helping guide each organism through its own, unique life.},

  abstract = {During pauses in exploration, ensembles of place cells in the rat hippocampus re-express firing sequences corresponding to recent spatial experience. Such “replay” co-occurs with ripple events: short-lasting (∼50–120 ms), high-frequency (∼200 Hz) oscillations that are associated with increased hippocampal-cortical communication. In previous studies, rats exploring small environments showed replay anchored to the rat's current location and compressed in time into a single ripple event. Here, we show, using a neural decoding approach, that firing sequences corresponding to long runs through a large environment are replayed with high fidelity and that such replay can begin at remote locations on the track. Extended replay proceeds at a characteristic virtual speed of ∼8 m/s and remains coherent across trains of ripple events. These results suggest that extended replay is composed of chains of shorter subsequences, which may reflect a strategy for the storage and flexible expression of memories of prolonged experience.},

Retention was measured by free recall after intervals of 0, 15 and 30 sec. A counting task was used to prevent rehearsal during the retention interval. The absolute level of recall increased with length of list whereas the percentages retained showed the reverse trend. The recall scores decreased steadily as a function of retention interval, with the rates of forgetting comparable for the three lengths of list. The decline in the amount recalled was due in large measure to the loss of the terminal items in the list. Consequently, the pronounced recency effect present on the immediate test of recall was progressively reduced as a function of time. By contrast retention of the initial part of the list was relatively stable. These variations in rate of forgetting are attributed to differences among serial positions in susceptibility to proactive inhibition.},

  abstract = {The principles of recency and contiguity are two cornerstones of the theoretical and empirical analysis of human memory. Recency has been alternatively explained by mechanisms of decay, displacement, and retroactive interference. Another account of recency is based on the idea of variable context (Estes, 1955; Mensink \&amp; Raaijmakers, 1989). Such notions are typically cast in terms of a randomly fluctuating population of elements reflective of subtle changes in the environment or in the subjects' mental state. This random context view has recently been incorporated into distributed and neural network memory models (Murdock, 1997; Murdock, Smith, \&amp; Bai, 2001). Here we propose an alternative model. Rather than being driven by random fluctuations, this formulation, the temporal context model (TCM), uses retrieval of prior contextual states to drive contextual drift. In TCM, retrieved context is an inherently asymmetric retrieval cue. This allows the model to provide a principled explanation of the widespread advantage for forward recalls in free and serial recall. Modeling data from single-trial free recall, we demonstrate that TCM can simultaneously explain recency and contiguity effects across time scales.},

  abstract = {Describes a model of free recall which identifies 2 processes: (a) retrieval, by which S accesses the words; and (b) recognition, by which S decides whether an implicitly retrieved word is a to-be-recalled word. Submodels for the recognition and retrieval processes are described. The recognition model assumes that during the study phase, S associates "list markers" to the to-be-recalled words. The establishment of such associates is postulated to be an all-or-none stochastic process. In the test phase, S recognizes to-be-recalled words by deciding which words have relevant list markers as associates. A signal detectability model is developed for this decision process. The retrieval model is introduced as a computer program that tags associative paths between list words. In 4 experiments, 41 male and 52 female 16-32 yr. old Ss studied and were tested on a sequence of overlapping sublists sampled from a master set of common nouns. Results confirm the prediction that S's ability to retrieve the words would increase as more overlapping sublists were studied, but his ability to differentiate the words on the most recent list should deteriorate. Further predictions derived from the free recall model were also supported. (56 ref.)},

  abstract = {Episodic memory proves essential for daily function, allowing us to remember where we parked the car, what time we walked the dog, or what a friend said earlier. In How We Remember, Michael Hasselmo draws on recent developments in neuroscience to present a new model describing the brain mechanisms for encoding and remembering such events as spatiotemporal trajectories. He reviews physiological breakthroughs on the regions implicated in episodic memory, including the discovery of grid cells, the cellular mechanisms of persistent spiking and resonant frequency, and the topographic coding of space and time. These discoveries inspire a theory for understanding the encoding and retrieval of episodic memory not just as discrete snapshots but as a dynamic replay of spatiotemporal trajectories, allowing us to "retrace our steps" to recover a memory. In the main text of the book, he presents the model in narrative form, accessible to scholars and advanced undergraduates in many fields. In the appendix, he presents the material in a more quantitative style, providing mathematical descriptions appropriate for advanced undergraduates and graduate students in neuroscience or engineering.},

Using intracranial recordings from 793 widespread cortical and subcortical sites in 10 epileptic patients undergoing invasive monitoring, we compared oscillatory power at frequencies ranging from 2 to 64 Hz as participants studied lists of common nouns. Significant increases in oscillatory power during encoding predicted subsequent recall, with this effect predominantly in the 4-8 Hz (theta) and 28-64 Hz (gamma) frequency bands. Sites exhibiting increased theta activity during successful encoding were clustered in right temporal and frontal cortex, whereas those exhibiting increased gamma activity appeared bilaterally at widespread cortical locations. These findings implicate theta and gamma oscillatory activity, across a widespread network of cortical regions, in the formation of new episodic memories.},

This increase in gamma oscillations was not seen in other frequency bands, whose activity generally decreased during successful memory formation.

Dissociations reported in some neuropsychological studies have contributed to a popular view that there must be neurally distinct memory stores that differentially support STM and LTM. In this article, we review evidence from recent studies regarding dissociations between STM and LTM. We suggest that the evidence reveals problems with claims of selective STM or LTM impairments, which in turn questions whether theories of memory need to propose neurally distinct stores for short- and long-term retention. We consider alternative ways to explain the neural mechanisms of memory across different retention intervals.},

Despite the existence of a large and stable empirical data base, theoretical progress has lagged behind experimental work. Some of the theoretical notions to date have included chaining of associations, nonassociative storage in bins, and reverberatory loops. These concepts have been valuable for application to individual paradigms, but a unified approach has been lacking. We present an extension to Murdock's Theory of Distributed Associative Memory (TODAM) based on associative chaining between items. A distributed memory system has a number of a priori advantages; it can sustain local damage without complete failure and requires no memory search for retrieval. We applied TODAM to a number of serial order phenomena—among them serial list learning, delayed recall effects, partial reports effects, and buildup and release from proactive interference—and found that the theory provided a good quantitative description of the data with a small set of parameters.},

With time, a reorganization of brain areas supporting memory takes place, which can ultimately result in memories becoming independent of the hippocampus. While it is theorized that with time, the neocortical representations become linked by higher order neocortical association areas, this remains to be experimentally supported. In this study, 24 human participants encoded sets of face–location associations, which they retrieved 1 or 25 h later (“recent” and “remote” conditions, respectively), while their brain activity was recorded using whole-head magnetoencephalography. We investigated changes in the functional interactions between the neocortical representational areas emerging over time. To assess functional interactions, trial-by-trial high gamma (60–140 Hz) power correlations were calculated between the neocortical representational areas relevant to the encoded information, namely the fusiform face area (FFA) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). With time, both the FFA and the PPC increased their functional interactions with the anterior temporal lobe (ATL). Given that the ATL is involved in semantic representation of paired associates, our results suggest that, already within 25 h after acquiring new memory associations, neocortical functional links are established via higher order semantic association areas.},

Here, we critically examine the major psychological theories (the “mind”) of short-term memory and how they relate to evidence about underlying brain mechanisms. We focus on three features that must be addressed by any satisfactory theory of short-term memory. First, we examine the evidence for the architecture of short-term memory, with special attention to questions of capacity and how—or whether—short-term memory can be separated from long-term memory. Second, we ask how the components of that architecture enact processes of encoding, maintenance, and retrieval. Third, we describe the debate over the reason about forgetting from short-term memory, whether interference or decay is the cause. We close with a conceptual model tracing the representation of a single item through a short-term memory task, describing the biological mechanisms that might support psychological processes on a moment-by-moment basis as an item is encoded, maintained over a delay with some forgetting, and ultimately retrieved.},

Long-term learning of sequences of familiar items is correctly predicted to interact with temporal grouping but not phonological similarity or articulatory suppression. However the model fails to predict learning of different sequences simultaneously, or of partially repeated lists. In a revised model, sufficiently different sequences recruit different context signals while sufficiently similar sequences recruit the same signal, via a cumulative matching process during encoding. Simulations show this revised model captures the experimental data on Hebb repetition, including the importance of matching at the start of a list, makes novel predictions concerning the effects of partial repetition, and provides a potential mechanism for position specific intrusions and the build up of proactive interference.},

No cellular mechanism has been proposed to explain how the mental representation of a response or idea is linked to the next. Using simultaneous recordings in monkeys, we revealed inhibitory interactions between neurons active at different time points relative to the cue presentation, delay interval and response period of a working memory task. These findings suggest an important role of inhibition in the cerebral cortex—controlling the timing of neuronal activities during cognitive operations and thereby shaping the temporal flow of information.},

The cortico-basal ganglia (BG) circuit addresses these demands by allowing the right motor plans to drive action at the right times, via a BG-mediated gate on motor representations. A long-standing hypothesis posits these same circuits are replicated in more rostral brain regions to support gating of cognitive representations. Key evidence now supports the prediction that BG can act as a gate on the input to working memory, as a gate on its output, and as a means of reallocating working memory representations rendered irrelevant by recent events. These discoveries validate key tenets of many computational models, circumscribe motor and cognitive models of recurrent cortical dynamics alone, and identify novel directions for research on the mechanisms of higher-level cognition.},

  abstract = {According to reinforcement learning theory of decision making, reward expectation is computed by integrating past rewards with a fixed timescale. In contrast, we found that a wide range of time constants is available across cortical neurons recorded from monkeys performing a competitive game task. By recognizing that reward modulates neural activity multiplicatively, we found that one or two time constants of reward memory can be extracted for each neuron in prefrontal, cingulate and parietal cortex. These timescales ranged from hundreds of milliseconds to tens of seconds, according to a power law distribution, which is consistent across areas and reproduced by a 'reservoir' neural network model. These neuronal memory timescales were weakly, but significantly, correlated with those of monkey's decisions. Our findings suggest a flexible memory system in which neural subpopulations with distinct sets of long or short memory timescales may be selectively deployed according to the task demands.

  abstract = {Memories can follow different processing routes. For example, some memories are enhanced during wakefulness while the enhancement of others is delayed until sleep. Converging evidence suggests that inhibitory mechanisms can ‘switch off’ a processing route, thereby preventing the consolidation of select memories during wakefulness. This switch arises due to an actively imposed ‘bottleneck’ generated by the brain. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can interfere with this bottleneck, allowing multiple memories to be consolidated simultaneously during wakefulness. This bottleneck restricts memory processing, perhaps allowing for the selection of only rewarded, or relevant memories. Overall, this bottleneck makes it necessary to select memories for consolidation, and the state of a switch (‘on’ or ‘off’) determines whether or not a memory is subsequently consolidated. Understanding how memory consolidation is regulated may provide novel therapeutic strategies.},

For over a century, the capacity of visual memory has been shown to vary substantially across individuals, ranging from 1.5 to about 5 objects. Although numerous studies have recently begun to characterize the neural substrates of visual memory processes, a neurophysiological index of storage capacity limitations has not yet been established. Here, we provide electrophysiological evidence for lateralized activity in humans that reflects the encoding and maintenance of items in visual memory. The amplitude of this activity is strongly modulated by the number of objects being held in the memory at the time, but approaches a limit asymptotically for arrays that meet or exceed storage capacity. Indeed, the precise limit is determined by each individual's memory capacity, such that the activity from low-capacity individuals reaches this plateau much sooner than that from high-capacity individuals. Consequently, this measure provides a strong neurophysiological predictor of an individual's capacity, allowing the demonstration of a direct relationship between neural activity and memory capacity.},

We found functional differences and frequency-specific interactions between HPC and PFC of monkeys learning object pair associations, an animal model of human explicit memory. PFC spiking activity reflected learning in parallel with behavioral performance, whereas HPC neurons reflected feedback about whether trial-and-error guesses were correct or incorrect. Theta-band HPC-PFC synchrony was stronger after errors, was driven primarily by PFC to HPC directional influences and decreased with learning. In contrast, alpha/beta-band synchrony was stronger after correct trials, was driven more by HPC and increased with learning. Rapid object associative learning may occur in PFC, whereas HPC may guide neocortical plasticity by signaling success or failure via oscillatory synchrony in different frequency bands.},

The current paper describes a working memory model that has recently gained popularity in basic research: the embedded-processes model (Cowan 1999). The embedded-processes model argues that working memory is not a separate cognitive system but is the activated part of long-term memory. A subset of activated long-term memory is assumed to be particularly highlighted and is termed the “focus of attention.” This model thus integrates working memory, long-term memory, and (voluntary and involuntary) attention, and referring to it within multimedia models provides the opportunity to model all these learning-relevant cognitive processes and systems in a unitary way. We make suggestions for incorporating this model into theories of multimedia learning. On this basis, one cannot only reinterpret crucial phenomena in multimedia learning that are attributed to working memory (the split-attention effect, the modality effect, the coherence effect, the signaling effect, the redundancy effect, and the expertise reversal effect) but also derive new predictions.},

In addition to behavioral results that are consistent with the idea that we can throw information out of visual working memory, recent neurophysiological recordings support this proposal. However, given the infinite capacity of long-term memory, it is unclear whether throwing a representation out of visual working memory really removes its effects on memory entirely. In this paper, we advocate for an approach that examines our ability to erase memory representations from working memory, as well as possible traces that those erased representations leave in long-term memory.},

This extreme limitation necessitates efficient mechanisms to select only the most relevant objects from the immediate environment to be represented in memory and to restrict irrelevant items from consuming capacity. Here we report a neurophysiological measure of this memory selection mechanism in humans that gauges an individual's efficiency at excluding irrelevant items from being stored in memory. By examining the moment-by-moment contents of visual memory, we observe that selection efficiency varies substantially across individuals and is strongly predicted by the particular memory capacity of each person. Specifically, high capacity individuals are much more efficient at representing only the relevant items than are low capacity individuals, who inefficiently encode and maintain information about the irrelevant items present in the display. These results provide evidence that under many circumstances low capacity individuals may actually store more information in memory than high capacity individuals. Indeed, this ancillary allocation of memory capacity to irrelevant objects may be a primary source of putative differences in overall storage capacity.},

The probe item evokes the search set on the basis of probe–memory item relatedness, just as a ringing tuning fork evokes sympathetic vibrations in other tuning forks. Evidence is accumulated in parallel from each probe–memory item comparison, and each comparison is modeled by a continuous random walk process. In item recognition, the decision process is self-terminating on matching comparisons and exhaustive on nonmatching comparisons. The mathematical model produces predictions about accuracy, mean reaction time, error latency, and reaction time distributions that are in good accord with data from 2 experiments conducted with 6 undergraduates. The theory is applied to 4 item recognition paradigms (Sternberg, prememorized list, study–test, and continuous) and to speed–accuracy paradigms; results are found to provide a basis for comparison of these paradigms. It is noted that neural network models can be interfaced to the retrieval theory with little difficulty and that semantic memory models may benefit from such a retrieval scheme.},

  abstract = {In Marcel Proust's most famous novel, In Search of Lost Time, a Madeleine cake elicited in him a nostalgic memory of Combray. Here we present a computational hypothesis of how such an episodic memory is represented in a brain area called the hippocampus, and how the dynamics of the hippocampus allow the storage and recall of such past events. Using the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF), we show how different aspects of an event, after compression, are represented together by hippocampal neurons as a vector in a high dimensional memory space. Single neuron simulation results using this representation scheme match well with the observation that hippocampal neurons are tuned to both spatial and non-spatial inputs. We then show that sequences of events represented by high dimensional vectors can be stored as episodic memories in a recurrent neural network (RNN) which is structurally similar to the hippocampus. We use a state-of-the-art Hessian-Free optimization algorithm to efficiently train this RNN. At the behavioural level we also show that, consistent with T-maze experiments on rodents, the storage and retrieval of past experiences facilitate subsequent decision-making tasks.},

  abstract = {Summary
The hippocampus is critical to remembering the flow of events in distinct experiences and, in doing so, bridges temporal gaps between discontiguous events. Here, we report a robust hippocampal representation of sequence memories, highlighted by “time cells” that encode successive moments during an empty temporal gap between the key events, while also encoding location and ongoing behavior. Furthermore, just as most place cells “remap” when a salient spatial cue is altered, most time cells form qualitatively different representations (“retime”) when the main temporal parameter is altered. Hippocampal neurons also differentially encode the key events and disambiguate different event sequences to compose unique, temporally organized representations of specific experiences. These findings suggest that hippocampal neural ensembles segment temporally organized memories much the same as they represent locations of important events in spatially defined environments.},

Theory regarding the cognitive function of the MTL has centered along 3 themes. Different authors have emphasized the role of the MTL in episodic recall, spatial navigation, or relational memory. Starting with the temporal context model (M. W. Howard \& M. J. Kahana, 2002a), a distributed memory model that has been applied to benchmark data from episodic recall tasks, the authors propose that the entorhinal cortex supports a gradually changing representation of temporal context and the hippocampus proper enables retrieval of these contextual states. Simulation studies show this hypothesis explains the firing of place cells in the entorhinal cortex and the behavioral effects of hippocampal lesion in relational memory tasks. These results constitute a first step toward a unified computational theory of MTL function that integrates neurophysiological, neuropsychological, and cognitive findings.},

Here, this process has been modeled based on the physiological properties of the hippocampal formation, including mechanisms for sustained activity in entorhinal cortex and theta rhythm oscillations in hippocampal subregions. The model simulates the context-sensitive firing properties of hippocampal neurons including trial-specific firing during spatial alternation and trial by trial changes in theta phase precession on a linear track. This activity is used to guide behavior, and lesions of the hippocampal network impair memory-guided behavior. The model links data at the cellular level to behavior at the systems level, describing a physiologically plausible mechanism for the brain to recall a given episode which occurred at a specific place and time.},

In the CMR model, organizational effects (the tendency for related items to cluster during the recall sequence) arise as a consequence of associations between active context elements and features of the studied material. Semantic clustering is due to longstanding context-to-item associations, whereas temporal clustering and source clustering are both due to associations formed during the study episode. A behavioral investigation of the three forms of organization provides data to constrain the CMR model, revealing interactions between the organizational factors. Finally, the authors discuss the implications of CMR for their understanding of a broad class of episodic memory phenomena and suggest ways in which this theory may guide exploration of the neural correlates of memory search.},

Lesions that block theta rhythm impair performance in tasks requiring reversalofpriorlearning, includingreversalinaT-maze, whereassociations between one arm location and food reward need to be extinguished in favor of associations between the opposite arm location and food reward. Here, a hippocampal model shows how theta rhythm could be important for reversal in this task by providing separate functional phases during each 100-300 msec cycle, consistent with physiological data. In the model, effective encoding of new associations occurs in the phase when synaptic input from entorhinal cortex is strong and long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory connections arising from hippocampal region CA3 is strong, but synaptic currents arising from region CA3 input are weak (to prevent interference from prior learned associations). Retrieval of old associations occurs in the phase when entorhinal input is weak and synaptic input from region CA3 is strong, but when depotentiation occurs at synapses from CA3 (to allow extinction of prior learned associations that do not match current input). These phasic changes require that LTP at synapses arising from region CA3 should be strongest at the phase when synaptic transmission at these synapses is weakest. Consistent with these requirements, our recent data show that synaptic transmission in stratum radiatum is weakest at the positive peak of local theta, which is when previous data show that induction of LTP is strongest in this layer.},

Results from a functional magnetic resonance imaging study showed that activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus during the initial stage of WM maintenance was predictive of subsequent LTM performance. In a behavioral experiment, we demonstrated that interfering with processing during the initial stage of WM maintenance impaired LTM formation.

We review the application of the CLS framework to a range of important topics, including the following: the basic neural processes of hippocampal memory encoding and recall, conjunctive encoding, human recognition memory, consolidation of initial hippocampal learning in cortex, dynamic modulation of encoding versus recall, and the synergistic interactions between hippocampus and neocortex. Overall, the CLS framework remains a vital theoretical force in the field, with the empirical data over the past 15 years generally confirming its key principles.},

The central principles are that the neocortex has a low learning rate and uses overlapping distributed representations to extract the general statistical structure of the environment, whereas the hippocampus learns rapidly using separated representations to encode the details of specific events while minimizing interference. In recent years, we have instantiated these principles in working computational models, and have used these models to address human and animal learning and memory findings, across a wide range of domains and paradigms. Here, we review a few representative applications of our models, focusing on two domains: recognition memory and animal learning in the fear-conditioning paradigm. In both domains, the models have generated novel predictions that have been tested and confirmed.},

  abstract = {Source memory depends on our ability to recollect contextual information-such as the time, place, feelings, and thoughts associated with a past event. It is acknowledged that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) plays a critical role in binding such episodic features. Yet, controversy exists over the nature of MTL binding-whether it contributes specifically to source recollection or whether it contributes equally to both item familiarity and source recollection. To resolve this issue, the authors propose that the MTL acts to bind contextual features through a process of hierarchical relational binding. That is, by way of multiple levels of associative bindings (i.e., bindings of bindings), the MTL links episodic features in a superadditive manner. To account for this binding feature, the authors develop a recognition model that includes positively skewed distributions of memory strength. Such skewed distributions can account for many empirical findings and regularities of both item familiarity and source recollection.},

  abstract = {Historically, the hippocampus has been viewed as a temporary memory structure. Consistent with the central premise of standard consolidation theory (SCT), a memory is initially hippocampus-dependent but, over time, it undergoes a consolidation process and eventually becoming represented in a distributed cortical network independent of the hippocampus. In this paper, we review evidence that is incompatible with each of the following essential features of SCT that are derived from its central premise: (1) Hippocampal damage reliably produces temporally graded retrograde amnesia, (2) all declarative explicit memories are equivalent with respect to consolidation, (3) consolidation entails a process of duplication in which a particular cortically based memory is identical to the hippocampus-dependent memory from which it derived, (4) consolidated memories are permanent and immutable. We propose an alternative hypothesis that assumes a transformation process and changes in the memory over time. Building on multiple trace theory (Nadel \&amp; Moscovitch, 1997), the transformation hypothesis contains three key elements that differentiate it from SCT: (1) An initially formed memory, which is assumed to be episodic and context-bound, remains dependent on the hippocampus for as long as it is available, (2) with time and experience, a hippocampal memory supports the development, in neocortex, of a less integrated, schematic version, which retains the gist of the original memory, but few of its contextual details, (3) there is a dynamic interplay between the two types of memory such that one or another may be dominant, depending on the circumstances at retrieval. Evidence is provided in support of the transformation hypothesis, which is advanced as a framework for unifying the seemingly disparate results of studies of anterograde and retrograde memory in the animal and human literatures.},

In Experiment 3, recall of categories and recall of words within a category were better for same-context than different-context recall. In Experiment 4, subjects given identical input conditions showed strong effects of environmental context when given a free recall test, yet showed no main effects of context on a recognition test. The absence of an environmental context effect on recognition was replicated in Experiment 5, using a cued recognition task to control the semantic encodings of test words.

Lists of words were presented to Ss who were then tested with an immediate free recall test prior to drug administration. Following injection delayed free recall and recognition tests were given. Subsequently two sets of lists were presented separately and tested in the same fashion. Two of the lists in the last set were composed of words falling into distinct categories. Memory was additionally analyzed by testing immediate recall of digit sequences and employing a visual recognition test. Subjective moods were evaluated with a rating questionnaire. Both diazepam and scopolamine impaired memory functions although the action of the latter drug was more pronounced and prolonged. The deficit appeared to be in the storage process leaving retrieval processes unaffected. Scopolamine in addition interfered with organizational processes. Subjectively, scopolamine also produced a larger sedative effect than diazepam.},

  abstract = {The Temporal Context Model (TCM) postulates a distributed representation of temporal context that provides the cue for episodic recall tasks. TCM, coupled with the Luce Choice Rule for determining probability of recall, a conjunction referred to as TCMFR, is able to explain the existence of the long-term recency effect, as well as predicting the persistence of associative effects even with the inclusion of a delay between items. Here, quantitative predictions of TCMFR such as the magnitude of the delay interval is increased in continuous-distractor free recall are developed. The magnitude of the recency effect is operationally defined as the ratio of the probability of first recall (PFR) of the last list item to the PFR of the next-to-last item. Properties of associative effects are operationalized by using analogous measures derived from conditional response probability (CRP) curves. TCMFR predicts a decrease in recency with increasing delay. The rate of this decay and the qualitative pattern of change with increasing delay depend on the rate of contextual drift. For a range of values of the rate of contextual drift, TCMFR also predicts a transient increase in the recency effect as the length of the delay increases from zero. The model predicts that contiguity effects in free recall should follow a similar pattern, but that associative asymmetry, ubiquitously observed in free recall, should decay monotonically with increases in the delay interval.},

A modified form of Tulving's method was used for appraising the development of subjectively determined sequential organization in free recall. Multiple randomizations were prepared for 10 stimulus words which were unrelated in the sense of lacking interitem associative strength according to free associational norms. Free recall was obtained after each presentation of the words. The unit of organization was the intertrial repetition which occurred whenever a pair of items recalled consecutively on trial n was repeated on trial n + 1. A formula was proposed for estimating the number of these units expected by chance. A monotonic increase in organization was found as the words were learned to the criterion of five consecutive errorless recalls.},

Retrieved temporal context models assume that (a) a distributed representation of temporal context changes gradually over time in response to the studied stimuli, and (b) repeating a stimulus can recover a prior state of temporal context.

  abstract = {More than three decades of research have demonstrated a role for hippocampal place cells in representation of the spatial environment in the brain. New studies have shown that place cells are part of a broader circuit for dynamic representation of self-location. A key component of this network is the entorhinal grid cells, which, by virtue of their tessellating firing fields, may provide the elements of a path integration–based neural map. Here we review how place cells and grid cells may form the basis for quantitative spatiotemporal representation of places, routes, and associated experiences during behavior and in memory. Because these cell types have some of the most conspicuous behavioral correlates among neurons in nonsensory cortical systems, and because their spatial firing structure reflects computations internally in the system, studies of entorhinal-hippocampal representations may offer considerable insight into general principles of cortical network dynamics.},

Cells that fired together when the animal occupied particular locations in the environment exhibited an increased tendency to fire together during subsequent sleep, in comparison to sleep episodes preceding the behavioral tasks. Cells that were inactive during behavior, or that were active but had non-overlapping spatial firing, did not show this increase. This effect, which declined gradually during each post-behavior sleep session, may result from synaptic modification during waking experience. Information acquired during active behavior is thus re-expressed in hippocampal circuits during sleep, as postulated by some theories of memory consolidation.},

The Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) proposes one such theory, but has not yet gathered significant empirical support, partly due to the technical challenge of building and simulating large-scale models with the NEF. Nengo is a software tool that can be used to build and simulate large-scale models based on the NEF; currently, it is the primary resource for both teaching how the NEF is used, and for doing research that generates specific NEF models to explain experimental data. Nengo 1.4, which was implemented in Java, was used to create Spaun, the world's largest functional brain model (Eliasmith et al., 2012). Simulating Spaun highlighted limitations in Nengo 1.4's ability to support model construction with simple syntax, to simulate large models quickly, and to collect large amounts of data for subsequent analysis. This paper describes Nengo 2.0, which is implemented in Python and overcomes these limitations. It uses simple and extendable syntax, simulates a benchmark model on the scale of Spaun 50 times faster than Nengo 1.4, and has a flexible mechanism for collecting simulation results.},

However, the original edition has been unavailable since 1966, ensuring that Hebb's comment that a classic normally means "cited but not read" is true in his case. This new edition rectifies a long-standing problem for behavioral neuroscientists--the inability to obtain one of the most cited publications in the field.   The Organization of Behavior played a significant part in stimulating the investigation of the neural foundations of behavior and continues to be inspiring because it provides a general framework for relating behavior to synaptic organization through the dynamics of neural networks.   D.O. Hebb was also the first to examine the mechanisms by which environment and experience can influence brain structure and function, and his ideas formed the basis for work on enriched environments as stimulants for behavioral development.   References to Hebb, the Hebbian cell assembly, the Hebb synapse, and the Hebb rule increase each year. These forceful ideas of 1949 are now applied in engineering, robotics, and computer science, as well as neurophysiology, neuroscience, and psychology--a tribute to Hebb's foresight in developing a foundational neuropsychological theory of the organization of behavior.},

This process takes a noisy approximation of a state and recovers the original information. As a particular example, we consider the cleanup required for the use of Vector Symbolic Architectures, which provide a method for manipulating symbols using a fixed-length vector representation. To recognize the result of these manipulations, a mechanism for cleaning up the resulting noisy representation is needed, as this noise increases with the number of symbols being combined. While these symbolic manipulations have previously been modelled with biologically plausible neurons, this paper presents the first spiking neuron model of the cleanup process. We demonstrate that it approaches ideal performance and that the neural requirements scale linearly with the number of distinct symbols in the system. While this result is relevant for any biological model requiring cleanup, it is crucial for VSAs, as it completes the set of mechanisms needed to provide a full neural implementation of symbolic reasoning.},

Monkeys drew the shapes as sequences of movement segments, and these segments were associated with distinct patterns of neuronal ensemble activity. Here we show that these patterns were present during the time preceding the actual drawing. The rank of the strength of representation of a segment in the neuronal population during this time, as assessed by discriminant analysis, predicted the serial position of the segment in the motor sequence. An analysis of errors in copying and their neural correlates supplied additional evidence for this code and provided a neural basis for Lashley's hypothesis that errors in motor sequences would be most likely to occur when executing elements that had prior representations of nearly equal strength.},

Recent data and neural circuit models highlight three distinct levels of temporal structure: sequence preparation, velocity scaling, and state-sensitive timing. Short sequences of actions are prepared collectively in prefrontal cortex, then queued for performance by a cyclic competitive process that operates on a parallel analog representation. Successful acts like ball-catching depend on coordinated scaling of effector velocities, and velocity scaling, mediated by the basal ganglia, may be coupled to perceived time-to-contact. Making acts accurate at high speeds requires state-sensitive and precisely timed activations of muscle forces in patterns that accelerate and decelerate the effectors. The cerebellum may provide a maximally efficient representational basis for learning to generate such timed activation patterns.},

Evidence from lesion, single-unit neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies shows that these visual working memory processes are consistently associated with sustained activity in object-selective inferior temporal neurons. Furthermore, results from these studies suggest that mnemonic activity in the inferior temporal cortex is, in turn, supported by top-down inputs from multimodal regions in prefrontal and medial temporal cortex, and under some circumstances, from the hippocampus.},

  abstract = {Now updated: the definitive neuroscience resource—from Eric R. Kandel, MD (winner of the Nobel Prize in 2000); James H. Schwartz, MD, PhD; Thomas M. Jessell, PhD; Steven A. Siegelbaum, PhD; and A. J. Hudspeth, PhD 900 full-color illustrations Deciphering the link between the human brain and behavior has always been one of the most intriguing—and often challenging—aspects of scientific endeavor. The sequencing of the human genome, and advances in molecular biology, have illuminated the pathogenesis of many neurological diseases and have propelled our knowledge of how the brain controls behavior.  To grasp the wider implications of these developments and gain a fundamental understanding of this dynamic, fast-moving field, Principles of Neuroscience stands alone as the most authoritative and indispensible resource of its kind.  In this classic text, prominent researchers in the field expertly survey the entire spectrum of neural science, giving an up-to-date, unparalleled view of the discipline for anyone who studies brain and mind. Here, in one remarkable volume, is the current state of neural science knowledge—ranging from molecules and cells, to anatomic structures and systems, to the senses and cognitive functions—all supported by more than 900 precise, full-color illustrations. In addition to clarifying complex topics, the book also benefits from a cohesive organization, beginning with an insightful overview of the interrelationships between the brain, nervous system, genes, and behavior. Principles of Neural Science then proceeds with an in-depth examination of the molecular and cellular biology of nerve cells, synaptic transmission, and the neural basis of cognition. The remaining sections illuminate how cells, molecules, and systems give us sight, hearing, touch, movement, thought, learning, memories, and emotions.  The new fifth edition of Principles of Neural Science is thoroughly updated to reflect the tremendous amount of research, and the very latest clinical perspectives, that have significantly transformed the field within the last decade.  Ultimately, Principles of Neural Science affirms that all behavior is an expression of neural activity, and that the future of clinical neurology and psychiatry hinges on the progress of neural science. Far exceeding the scope and scholarship of similar texts, this unmatched guide offers a commanding, scientifically rigorous perspective on the molecular mechanisms of neural function and disease—one that you’ll continually rely on to advance your comprehension of brain, mind, and behavior.  FEATURES   The cornerstone reference in the field of neuroscience that explains how the nerves, brain, and mind function  Clear emphasis on how behavior can be examined through the electrical activity of both individual neurons and systems of nerve cells  Current focus on molecular biology as a tool for probing the pathogenesis of many neurological diseases, including muscular dystrophy, Huntington disease, and certain forms of Alzheimer’s disease  More than 900 engaging full-color illustrations—including line drawings, radiographs, micrographs, and medical photographs clarify often-complex neuroscience concepts  Outstanding section on the development and emergence of behavior, including important coverage of brain damage repair, the sexual differentiation of the nervous system,  and the aging brain  NEW! More detailed discussions of cognitive and behavioral functions, and an expanded review of cognitive processes  NEW! A focus on the increasing importance of computational neural science, which enhances our ability to record the brain’s electrical activity and study cognitive processes more directly  NEW! Chapter-opening Key Concepts provide a convenient, study-enhancing introduction to the material covered in each chapter  Selected Readings and full reference citations at the close of each chapter facilitate further study and research  Helpful appendices highlight basic circuit theory; the neurological examination of the patient; circulation of the brain; the blood-brain barrier, choroid plexus, and cerebrospinal fluid; neural networks; and theoretical approaches to neuroscience/ul\ensuremath{>}},

During this period large number of anatomical, neurochemical and electrophysiological data have been accumulated. While excellent reviews have been published on the anatomy and electrophysiology of hippocampal formation, the neurochemistry of this area has not been thoroughly surveyed. Therefore the aim of this review is to summarize the neurochemical and pharmacological data on the release of the major neurotransmitters found in the hippocampal region: glutamate (GLU), γ-amino butyric acid (GABA), acetylcholine (ACh), noradrenaline (NA) and serotonin (5-HT). In addition, this review analyzes the synaptic and nonsynaptic interactions between hippocampal neuronal elements and overviews how auto- and heteroreceptors are involved in the presynaptic modulation of transmitter release. The presented data clearly show that transmitters released from axon terminals without synaptic contact play an important role in the fine tuning of communication between neurons within a neuronal circuit.

This phenomenon is known as implicit memory. The neural correlates of implicit memory have been studied previously, but they have never been compared with the correlates of explicit memory while holding task conditions constant or while using a procedure that ensured that the neural correlates were not 'contaminated' by explicit memory. Here we use scalp-recorded event-related brain potentials to identify neural activity associated with implicit and explicit memory during the performance of a recognition memory task. Relative to new words, recently studied words produced activity in three neuroanatomically and functionally dissociable neural populations. One of these populations was activated whether or not the word was consciously recognized, and its activity therefore represents a neural correlate of implicit memory. Thus, when task and memory contamination effects are eliminated, the neural correlates of explicit and implicit memory differ qualitatively.},

Stimuli with minimal pre-experimental meaning allow direct comparisons between these two types of priming and explorations of whether corresponding neural mechanisms differ. We therefore examined electrophysiological correlates of perceptual and conceptual priming for minimalist geometric shapes (squiggles). Response time measures of conceptual priming were evident for squiggles rated by individual subjects as most meaningful, but not for those rated least meaningful. Conceptual-priming magnitude was proportional across individuals to the amplitude of FN400 brain potentials, but only for meaningful squiggles. Perceptual priming was evident for squiggles irrespective of meaningfulness, and perceptual-priming magnitude was proportional to the amplitude of frontal P170 potentials. These findings therefore show that a single exposure to a novel stimulus can lead to neural processing accompanying conceptual priming that is distinct from that accompanying perceptual priming (FN400 potentials vs. P170 potentials, respectively). Overall, this evidence is also relevant to the current debate over the neural correlates of familiarity-based recognition, and runs counter to the prominent supposition that familiarity can be generically indexed by FN400 potentials.},

  abstract = {Results from behavioral studies have supported the idea that recognition memory can be supported by at least two different processes, recollection and familiarity. However, it remains unclear whether these two forms of memory reflect neurally distinct processes. Furthermore, it is unclear whether recollection and familiarity can be best conceived as differing primarily in terms of retrieval processing, or whether they additionally differ at encoding. To address these issues, we used event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to monitor neural correlates of familiarity and recollection at both encoding and retrieval. Participants studied pictures of objects in two types of study blocks and subsequently made remember–know and source memory judgments during retrieval. Results showed that, during encoding, neural correlates of subsequent familiarity and recollection onsetted in parallel, but exhibited differences in scalp topography and time course. Subsequent familiarity-based recognition was associated with a left-lateralized enhanced positivity and observed at anterior scalp sites from 300 to 450 ms, whereas subsequent recollection was associated with a topographically distinct right-lateralized positivity at anterior scalp sites from 300 to 450 ms and bilateral activity from 450 to 600 ms. During retrieval, neural correlates of familiarity emerged earlier than correlates of recollection. Familiarity was associated with an enhanced positivity at frontopolar scalp sites from 150 to 450 ms, whereas recollection was associated with positive ERP modulations over bilateral frontal (300–600 ms) and parietal (450–800 ms) sites. These results demonstrate that familiarity and recollection reflect the outcome of neurally distinct memory processes at both encoding and retrieval.},

However, empirical research is mixed as to whether it is possible to selectively maintain a subset of the information previously encoded into visual working memory. Here we examined the ability of participants to use cues to either forget or remember a subset of the information already stored in visual working memory. In Experiment 1, participants were cued to either forget or remember 1 of 2 groups of colored squares during a change-detection task. We found that both types of cues aided performance in the visual working memory task but that observers benefited more from a cue to remember than a cue to forget a subset of the objects. In Experiment 2, we show that the previous findings, which indicated that directed-forgetting cues are ineffective, were likely due to the presence of invalid cues that appeared to cause observers to disregard such cues as unreliable. In Experiment 3, we recorded event-related potentials and show that an electrophysiological index of focused maintenance is elicited by cues that indicate which subset of information in visual working memory needs to be remembered, ruling out alternative explanations of the behavioral effects of retention-interval cues. The present findings demonstrate that observers can focus maintenance mechanisms on specific objects in visual working memory based on cues indicating future task relevance.},

Repeating words in the context of different sentences might cause separate storage of the repetitions of a given word, because either word or sentence traces are stored separately. Separate storage would, in effect, convert a list-strength manipulation into a list-length manipulation and thereby induce a positive list-strength effect. In Experiment 1, this result was produced for single-word recognition and for two types of sentence recognition. In Experiment 2, both words and sentences were repeated together, which should have caused repetitions to be stored in a single, stronger, trace. As expected, the list-strength effect was eliminated. A sentence trace model was fit to the data, supporting the account of Shiffrin et al. (1990) and supporting an account of word and sentence recognition in which activation is summed for representations of all list items. The results from the two studies are inconsistent with most current models of memory (as shown by the theoretical analyses of Shiffrin et al., 1990) and pose an additional challenge for theory.},

  abstract = {Previous recognition memory studies have looked for differences in brain activity during recollection- and familiarity-based responding. Although an ERP component correlated with recollection success has been reported, no analogous component related to search initiation has been found. We argue that such a component has not been discovered because studies have compared trials in which participants have made a search attempt and failed (such as Know responses) with those in which the search attempt is successful (such as Remember responses). In the current study, we compared a task that required judgments of lifetime familiarity (differentiating famous from nonfamous names) with one that required judgments of episodic information (deciding whether a name was seen previously in the experiment). By comparing a task on which familiarity judgments were made with no search attempt to a second task in which a search attempt was likely to occur, we identified a component that may reflect the initiation of a memory search. This effect, maximal between 190 and 235 ms, is correlated with Old judgments in the episodic task. Previous ERP findings (e.g., FN400, parietal old/new effect) were also replicated in the present study.},

We examined the management of VWM in a task that required participants to prioritize individual objects for retention during scene viewing. There were 5 principal findings: (a) Strategic retention of task-relevant objects was effective and was dissociable from the current locus of visual attention; (b) strategic retention was implemented by protection from interference rather than by preferential encoding; (c) this prioritization was flexibly transferred to a new object as task demands changed; (d) no-longer-relevant items were efficiently eliminated from VWM; and (e) despite this level of control, attended and fixated objects were consolidated into VWM regardless of task relevance. These results are consistent with a model of VWM control in which each fixated object is automatically encoded into VWM, replacing a portion of the content in VWM. However, task-relevant objects can be selectively protected from replacement.},

However, when a large reward was possible, the neural signature of working memory returned as subjects recruited working memory to supplement the cognitive control afforded by the representations accumulated in long-term memory. The amplitude of this neural signature of working memory predicted the magnitude of the subsequent behavioral reward-based attention effects across tasks and individuals, showing the ubiquity of this cognitive reaction to high-stakes situations.},

We have no extended these observations to the two major cytoarchitectonic fields of the hippocampus (the regio superior or field CA1; and the regio inferior or field CA3). The mean number of pyramidal neurons in field CA1 of 1-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats is 420,000 (± 60,000 S.E.), while Wistar rats at the same age have 320,000 (± 20,000). The numbers of neurons in field CA3 in the two strains are: 330,000 (± 30,000) and 210,000 (± 20,000), respectively. Whether these strain differences reflect specific differences in the neural organization of the hippocampal formation in the two strains, or are related to more general differences in total body weight or brain weight, is unknown. Since during the first two days postnatally we estimate that there are between 358,000 and 491,000 cells in field CA1 of Sprague-Dawley rats, it would seem that there is no significant naturally-occuring neuronal death in this hippocampal field. This may be due to the extensive collateral projections of the hippocampal pyramidal neurons.},

  abstract = {The axon collaterals of dentate granule cells have been analyzed with the aid of a computerized microscope, following intracellular injections of horseradish peroxidase in hippocampal slice preparations. The axon of each granule cell gives rise to approximately seven primary collaterals; these collaterals usually divide into secondary and tertiary branches, which form an extensive plexus within the hilar region of the dentate gyrus. Individual axon collaterals vary greatly in length, but most have been found to be between 100 and 300 μm long. On average, the summed lengths of the collaterals (exclusive of the parent mossy fiber) are approximately 2,300 μm. Except for an occasional collateral that is given off by a mossy fiber in the proximal part of field CA3 of the hippocampus, the collaterals of the granule cell axons are confined to the hilar region; they are rarely seen in the granule cell layer itself and have never been observed in the molecular layer. In the longitudinal dimension of the dentate gyros, most of the collaterals are contained within a zone about 400 μm wide. The distribution of the collaterals within the hilar region is correlated with the location of the granule cell body. Those that arise from cells near the tip of the suprapyramidal blade tend to be confined to the region above field CA3; those from cells nearer the crest and from the infrapyramidal blade ramify widely throughout the hilus. Two types of varicosities are present on the collaterals. Numerous small (∼2 μm), round varicosities are distributed unevenly along the collaterals; in electron micrographs these varicosities can be seen to make asymmetric synaptic contacts with dendritic shafts. On average, each granule cell collateral plexus his about 160 of these varicosities. The second type of varicosity is irregular in shape and ranges from 2 to 4 μm in diameter; there is usually only one sucil varicosity per collateral. In all respects except size, these varicosities rE semble the expansions found on the parent mossy fibers. Mossy fiber trajectories in the proximal part of field CA3 were studied after extracellular injections of HRP into localized regions of the granule cell layer. Granule cells at different locations around the blade send their mossy fibers to different depths within the pyramidal cell layer in the proximal part of field CA3. However, further distally, mossy fibers from all parts of the granule cell layer contribute to the suprapyramidal bundle that occupies the stratum lucidum.},

  abstract = {Rats implanted with recording and stimulating electrodes were trained to run in an activity wheel for a water reward. Unitary discharges and slow activity were recorded by a movable tungsten microelectrode and by fixed electrodes. Single cells were classified according to their spontaneous and evoked response properties as pyramidal cells, granule cells and interneurons. Unit activity, EEG and their interrelations were studied by spectral and spike-triggered averaging methods. Gradual phase-shifts of RSA were observed both in CA1 and the dentate gyrus. Movement-related RSA was correlated with a decrease in firing rate of pyramidal cells and an increase in the firing of both interneurons and granule cells. In the CA1 region pyramidal cells and interneurons fired preferentially on the negative and positive phases of the locally derived RSA, respectively. In the dentate gyrus both granule cells and interneurons discharged mainly on the positive portion of the local RSA waves, about 90° before the CA1 pyramidal cells. Fourier analysis of the spike trains of interneurons and granule cells showed high power at RSA frequency, coherent with the concurrent EEG. Phase relations between discharges of interneurons and RSA remained unchanged following urethane anesthesia. In waking rats, atropine administration resulted in a decreased discharge of interneurons at RSA frequency, and reduced coherence with RSA. Lesions of the septum or the fimbria-fornix abolished RSA and the rhythmic discharges of the interneurons. Isolation of the entorhinal cortex (EC) from its cortical inputs did not change either EEG or neuronal firing. However, in such a preparation atropine completely abolished RSA and related rhythmicity of interneurons. During drinking and immobility but not during walking, sharp waves (SPW) of about 40–100 ms duration appeared in the EEG. SPWs were invariably accompanied by synchronous discharges of several pyramidal cells and interneurons. CA3 pyramidal cells also discharged in synchronous bursts but without local SPWs. Laminar profiles of SPWs and the field potentials evoked by stimulation of Schaf fer collaterals were essentially identical. The behavior-dependent occurrence of SPWs was retained following atropine administration, septal lesion or EC isolation but was lost after fimbria-for-nix-neocortex lesion or following atropine administration in EC isolated rats. In addition to relations to RSA and SPWs, interneurons were phase-locked to the fast EEG pattern (25–70 Hz). This relationship was preserved following lesions of the septum or the fimbria-fornix complex. The above findings allowed us to construct a new model of hippocampal RSA generation based on feed-forward inhibition from the septum and a direct excitation by the entorhinal input. SPWs are suggested to reflect strong synaptic activation of CA1 pyramidal cells via the Schaffer collaterals as a consequence of synchronous discharges of CA3 pyramidal neurons. Fast activity is supposed to reflect synaptic activity close to the somata of pyramidal cells and granule cells.},

Partial deafferentation of the hippocampus obtained by destruction of the dorsal routes (through the fimbria-fornix and the supracallosal striae) resulted in removal of 90\% and 60\% of the cholinergic and adrenergic innervations, respectively, within one month. By 6–10 months after lesion, the remaining cholinergic and adrenergic inputs, reaching the target via the ventral route, had expanded more than two-fold, resulting in a significant recovery in the original cholinergic and adrenergic innervation patterns. Because of its slow and protracted time-course and its ability to re-establish innervation also in initially denervated areas, this compensatory collateral sprouting phenomenon may be of particular interest for the understanding of the long-term, protracted functional recovery that is seen both after experimental brain lesions as well as in patients with severe brain injuries.},

  abstract = {We examine two different descriptions of the behavioral functions of the hippocampal system. One emphasizes spatially organized behaviors, especially those using cognitive maps. The other emphasizes memory, particularly working memory, a short-term memory that requires iexible stimulus-response associations and is highly susceptible to interference. The predictive value of the spatial and memory descriptions were evaluated by testing rats with damage to the hippocampal system in a series of experiments, independently manipulating the spatial and memory characteristics of a behavioral task. No dissociations were found when the spatial characteristics of the stimuli to be remembered were changed; lesions produced a similar deficit in both spatial and nonspatial test procedures, indicating that the hippocampus was similarly involved regardless of the spatial nature of the task. In contrast, a marked dissociation was found when the memory requirements were altered. Rats with lesions were able to perform accurately in tasks that could be solved exclusively on the basis of reference memory. They performed at chance levels and showed no signs of recovery even with extensive postoperative training in tasks that required working memory. In one experiment all the characteristics of the reference memory and working memory procedures were identical except the type of memory required. Consequently, the behavioral dissociation cannot be explained by differences in attention, motivation, response inhibition, or the type of stimuli to be remembered. As a result of these experiments we propose that the hippocampus is selectively involved in behaviors that require working memory, irrespective of the type of material (spatial or nonspatial) that is to be processed by that memory.},

This is suggested by the psychotomimetic effects of NMDA antagonists, the ameliorative effects of NMDAR indirect agonists, elevated levels of the NMDA antagonist N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG) in schizophrenic brain, and findings from recent genetic studies. However, the link between reduced NMDAR function and the behavioral features of schizophrenics has not been made explicit. Here we present a network simulation of hippocampal function, focused on retrieval of verbal stimuli in human memory tasks. Specifically, we trained a computational model of the hippocampal complex to perform a context-dependent paired associate task, a free recall task with category clustering, and the transitive inference (TI) task. In this network, direct perforant pathway input from entorhinal cortex to region CA1 provides the basis for semantic context cueing during initial encoding and retrieval, allowing selective retrieval on the basis of category cues. Alterations in the magnitude of this direct perforant pathway input to region CA1 causes impairments in use of organizational strategies for memory, accounting for specific features of memory dysfunction in schizophrenics and in normals treated with ketamine. This model provides a theoretical link between cellular physiological changes and specific cognitive symptoms. As such, it can shed light on the etiology of schizophrenia in a fundamental way, and also holds the promise of pointing the way to more effective treatments.},

When the same event is repeated after such time periods, the activity patterns of hippocampal CA1 cell populations progressively differ with increasing temporal distances. Coding for space and context is nonetheless preserved. Compared with CA1, the firing patterns of hippocampal CA3 cell populations are highly reproducible, irrespective of the time interval, and thus provide a stable memory code over time. Therefore, the neuronal activity patterns in CA1 but not CA3 include a code that can be used to distinguish between time intervals on an extended scale, consistent with behavioral studies showing that the CA1 area is selectively required for temporal coding over such periods.},

The results suggest that a gradual change in the pattern of hippocampal activity served as a temporal context for odor-sampling events and was important for successful subsequent memory of the order of those odors.},

  abstract = {The hippocampal CA3 subregion is critical for rapidly encoding new memories, which suggests that neuronal computations are implemented in its circuitry that cannot be performed elsewhere in the hippocampus or in the neocortex. Recording studies show that CA3 cells are bound to a large degree to a spatial coordinate system, while CA1 cells can become more independent of a map-based mechanism and allow for a larger degree of arbitrary associations, also in the temporal domain. The mapping of CA3 onto a spatial coordinate system intuitively points to its role in spatial navigation but does not directly suggest how such a mechanism may support memory processing. Although bound to spatial coordinates, the CA3 network can rapidly alter its firing rate in response to novel sensory inputs and is thus not as strictly tied to spatial mapping as grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex. Such rate coding within an otherwise stable spatial map can immediately incorporate new sensory inputs into the two-dimensional matrix of CA3, where they can be integrated with already stored information about each place. CA3 cell ensembles may thus support the fast acquisition of detailed memories by providing a locally continuous, but globally orthogonal representation, which can rapidly provide a new neuronal index when information is encountered for the first time. This information can be interpreted in CA1 and other downstream cortical areas in the context of less spatially restricted information.},

  abstract = {The mechanisms for pattern completion and pattern separation are described in the context of a theory of hippocampal function in which the hippocampal CA3 system operates as a single attractor or autoassociation network to enable rapid, one-trial, associations between any spatial location (place in rodents, or spatial view in primates) and an object or reward, and to provide for completion of the whole memory during recall from any part. The factors important in the pattern completion in CA3 together with a large number of independent memories stored in CA3 include a sparse distributed representation which is enhanced by the graded firing rates of CA3 neurons, representations that are independent due to the randomizing effect of the mossy fibers, heterosynaptic long-term depression as well as long-term potentiation in the recurrent collateral synapses, and diluted connectivity to minimize the number of multiple synapses between any pair of CA3 neurons which otherwise distort the basins of attraction. Recall of information from CA3 is implemented by the entorhinal cortex perforant path synapses to CA3 cells, which in acting as a pattern associator allow some pattern generalization. Pattern separation is performed in the dentate granule cells using competitive learning to convert grid-like entorhinal cortex firing to place-like fields. Pattern separation in CA3, which is important for completion of any one of the stored patterns from a fragment, is provided for by the randomizing effect of the mossy fiber synapses to which neurogenesis may contribute, by the large number of dentate granule cells each with a sparse representation, and by the sparse independent representations in CA3. Recall to the neocortex is achieved by a reverse hierarchical series of pattern association networks implemented by the hippocampo-cortical backprojections, each one of which performs some pattern generalization, to retrieve a complete pattern of cortical firing in higher-order cortical areas.},

A large body of evidence from human studies indicates that structures in the medial temporal lobe are critically involved in forming and maintaining such memories, and complementing evidence from lesion and electrophysiological work in animals support these findings. However, it remains unclear how single cells and networks of cells can signal this temporal relationship between events. Here we used recordings from single cells in the human brain obtained while subjects viewed repeated presentations of cinematic episodes. We found that neuronal activity in successive time segments became gradually correlated, and, as a result, activity in a given time window became a faithful predictor of the activity to follow. This correlation emerged rapidly, within two to three presentations of an episode and exceeded both context-independent and pure stimulus-driven correlations. The correlation was specific for hippocampal neurons, did not occur in the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex, and was found for single cells, cell pairs, and triplets of cells, supporting the notion that cell assemblies code for the temporal relationships between sensory events. Importantly, this neuronal measure of temporal binding successfully predicted subjects’ ability to recall and verbally report the viewed episodes later. Our findings suggest a neuronal substrate for the formation of memory of the temporal order of events.},

Regularities are gradually represented in cortex after extensive experience {[}1{]}, and yet they can influence behavior after minimal exposure {[}2, 3{]}. What kind of representations support such rapid statistical learning? The medial temporal lobe (MTL) can represent information from even a single experience {[}4{]}, making it a good candidate system for assisting in initial learning about regularities. We combined anatomical segmentation of the MTL, high-resolution fMRI, and multivariate pattern analysis to identify representations of objects in cortical and hippocampal areas of human MTL, assessing how these representations were shaped by exposure to regularities. Subjects viewed a continuous visual stream containing hidden temporal relationships—pairs of objects that reliably appeared nearby in time. We compared the pattern of blood oxygen level-dependent activity evoked by each object before and after this exposure, and found that perirhinal cortex, parahippocampal cortex, subiculum, CA1, and CA2/CA3/dentate gyrus (CA2/3/DG) encoded regularities by increasing the representational similarity of their constituent objects. Most regions exhibited bidirectional associative shaping, whereas CA2/3/DG represented regularities in a forward-looking predictive manner. These findings suggest that object representations in MTL come to mirror the temporal structure of the environment, supporting rapid and incidental statistical learning.},

  abstract = {The idea of episodic memory implies the existence of a process that segments experience into episodes so that they can be stored in memory. It is therefore surprising that the link between event segmentation and the organization of experiences into episodes in memory has not been addressed. We found that after participants read narratives containing temporal event boundaries at varying locations in the narrative, their long-term associative memory for information across event boundaries was lower than their memory for information within an event. This suggests that event segmentation during encoding resulted in segmentation of those same events in memory. Further, functional imaging data revealed that, across participants, brain activity consistent with the ongoing integration of information within events correlated with this pattern of mnemonic segmentation. These data are the first to address the mechanisms that support the organization of experiences into episodes in long-term memory.},

Second, cells in deep layers of the EC, the targets of hippocampal outputs, appeared to represent the similarities between locations on spatially distinct trajectories through the environment. Our findings suggest that the hippocampus represents the animal's position in the context of a trajectory through space and that the EC represents regularities across different trajectories that could allow for generalization across experiences.},

(2) The origin of journeys influenced firing even when rats made detours, showing that recent memory could modulate neuronal activity more than spatial trajectory. (3) Diminished retrospective coding and, more markedly, reduced prospective coding in error trials suggested that the neuronal signal was important for task performance.

The STM primacy effects can be used to generate correct immediate recall of short lists that have not been coded in LTM. The properties of the model are interpreted in terms of explicit neural mechanisms. The STM primacy effect is a behavioral contrast effect that is analogous to the behavioral contrast that can occur during discrimination learning. The adaptational mechanism that accounts for these effects is also implicated in data on reaction time, retinal adaptation, ratio scales in choice behavior, and von Restorff-type effects. Its ubiquitous appearance is due to the fact that it solves a universal problem concerning the parallel processing of patterned data by noisy cells with finitely many excitable sites. It is argued that the STM primacy effect is not measured in interference experiments because it is masked by competitive STM interactions. These competitive interactions do not prevent the LTM primacy effect from influencing performance. The paper criticizes recent models of STM that use computer analogies to justify binary codes, serial STM buffers, and serial scanning procedures. Several deficiencies of serial models in dealing with psychological and neural processing are overcome by a model in which continuous STM activities and parallel real-time operations play an important role.},

Rats with an isolated CA1 area showed normal acquisition of an associative hippocampal-dependent spatial recognition task. Spatial recall was impaired. These results suggest that the hippocampus contains two functionally separable memory circuits: The direct entorhinal-CA1 system is sufficient for recollection-based recognition memory, but recall depends on intact CA3-CA1 connectivity.},

Convolution is used as the storage operation, and correlation is used as the retrieval operation. A distributed memory system is assumed; all information is stored in a common memory vector. In principle, the theory can apply to item recognition, order recognition, probe and ordered recall, judgments of recency and frequency, lexical decision, and storage of higher-order units such as chunks or propositions. It applies to both accuracy and latency. Performance is predicted from the moments (expectation and variance) of the similarity distributions, and these can be derived from the theory. A canonical version of discrete memory models is outlined as a basis for comparison; it does not fit some serial-order recognition data as well as the distributed memory model does. (78 ref)},

  abstract = {The only attempts to account for order errors in serial recall, have been informational analyses leading to models involving separate storage for item and order information. The present study begins by showing that there is a high degree of association between order and item errors. Items which acoustically confuse with each other are likely to transpose in recall.

This result suggests that apparent order error could arise from two or more independent item errors substituting for each other. Taking into account the demonstrated association between acoustic similarity of items and liability to confuse in recall, the chance that two independent item errors will form a transposition is much increased beyond the pure chance level. This chance is even further increased because (a) acoustic confusions in recall reciprocate, and (b) when sequences are such that repetition of items does not occur, when Ss have made one mistake, they are more willing to make a wrong report on a later item than to be led into a repetition.

It is concluded that memory models do not necessarily need a mechanism which could transpose the order of items in storage. A simpler model is suggested in which items are fixed in the input order, encoded only according to properties of individual items. There is in addition a response availability store from which item substitutions are drawn. The size of this store is independent of vocabulary size, is relatively small, and consists primarily of recent responses only. Thus even when sequence items are drawn from a very large vocabulary, this modified mutual substitution model would still be adequate to account for differences between the order in which items enter and leave a memory store.},

  abstract = {O'Keefe and Recce {[}1993{]} Hippocampus 3:317–330 described an interaction between the hippocampal theta rhythm and the spatial firing of pyramidal cells in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus: they found that a cell's spike activity advances to earlier phases of the theta cycle as the rat passes through the cell's place field. The present study makes use of large-scale parallel recordings to clarify and extend this finding in several ways: 1) Most CA1 pyramidal cells show maximal activity at the same phase of the theta cycle. Although individual units exhibit deeper modulation, the depth of modulation of CA1 population activity is about 50\%. The peak firing of inhibitory interneurons in CA1 occurs about 60° in advance of the peak firing of pyramidal cells, but different interneurons vary widely in their peak phases. 2) The first spikes, as the rat enters a pyramidal cell's place field, come 90°–120° after the phase of maximal pyramidal cell population activity, near the phase where inhibition is least. 3) The phase advance is typically an accelerating, rather than linear, function of position within the place field. 4) These phenomena occur both on linear tracks and in two-dimensional environments where locomotion is not constrained to specific paths. 5) In two-dimensional environments, place-related firing is more spatially specific during the early part of the theta cycle than during the late part. This is also true, to a lesser extent, on a linear track. Thus, spatial selectivity waxes and wanes over the theta cycle. 6) Granule cells of the fascia dentata are also modulated by theta. The depth of modulation for the granule cell population approaches 100\%, and the peak activity of the granule cell population comes about 90° earlier in the theta cycle than the peak firing of CA1 pyramidal cells. 7) Granule cells, like pyramidal cells, show robust phase precession. 8) Cross-correlation analysis shows that portions of the temporal sequence of CA1 pyramidal cell place fields are replicated repeatedly within individual theta cycles, in highly compressed form. The compression ratio can be as much as 10:1. These findings indicate that phase precession is a very robust effect, distributed across the entire hippocampal population, and that it is likely to be inherited from the fascia dentata or an earlier stage in the hippocampal circuit, rather than generated intrinsically within CA1. It is hypothesized that the compression of temporal sequences of place fields within individual theta cycles permits the use of long-term potentiation for learning of sequential structure, thereby giving a temporal dimension to hippocampal memory traces. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

This is referred to as the rate code. However, the biophysical laws of synaptic plasticity require precise timing of spikes over short timescales (\ensuremath{<}10 ms). Hence it is critical to understand the physiological mechanisms that can generate precise spike timing in vivo, and the relationship between such a temporal code and a rate code. Here we propose a mechanism by which a temporal code can be generated through an interaction between an asymmetric rate code and oscillatory inhibition. Consistent with the predictions of our model, the rate and temporal codes of hippocampal pyramidal neurons are highly correlated. Furthermore, the temporal code becomes more robust with experience. The resulting spike timing satisfies the temporal order constraints of hebbian learning. Thus, oscillations and receptive field asymmetry may have a critical role in temporal sequence learning.},

  abstract = {Two experiments, concerned with the improving effects of grouping on auditory short-term memory, are described. In the first, temporal grouping was found to improve recall considerably, but non-temporal grouping had a much smaller effect. Temporal grouping reduced the order errors more than other errors; it also changed the pattern of the order errors. Further, it altered the shape of the serial position curve of all errors. In the second experiment, irregular patterns of temporal grouping were found to be inferior to a regular pattern. The results are discussed in terms of the time available for processing previous items during the presentation of a sequence, and the form that this processing may take.

Subjects were instructed not to rehearse any digits outside the group currently being presented. Rehearsing in 3's was optimal, irrespective of list length. Both recall of items and recall of the correct positions of items improved from 1's to 2's to 3's. Recall of items declined very little from 3's to 4's to 5's, but recall of position declined sharply. Errors in positioning digits tended, above chance, to be in the same group or the same position in a different group. The results suggest that both item-to-item associations and serial positin-to-item associations are formed in short-term memory, that only two or three serial position cues are used, but that these serial position cues can be hierarchically organized into a beginning, middle, and end group and a beginning, middle, and end position within a group.},

  abstract = {Single neuron activity was recorded in the granular layer of the fascia dentata in freely moving rats, while the animals performed a spatial “working” memory task on an eight-arm maze. Using recording methods that facilitate detection of units with low discharge rates, it was found that the majority (88\%) of cells in this layer have mean rates below 0.5 Hz, with a minimum of 0.01 Hz or less. The remaining recorded cells exhibited characteristics typical of the theta interneurons found throughout the hippocampus. Based on several criteria including relative proportion and the relation of their evoked discharges to the population spike elicited by perforant path stimulation, it was concluded that the low-rate cells correspond to granule cells. Granule cells exhibited clear spatially and directionally selective discharge that was at least as selective as that of a sample of CA3 pyramidal cells recorded under the same conditions. Granule cells had significantly smaller place fields than pyramidal cells, and tended to have more discontiguous subfields. There was no spatial correlation among simultaneously recorded adjacent granule cells. Granule cells also exhibited burst discharges reminiscent of complex spikes from pyramidal cells while the animals sat quietly; however, the spike duration of granule cells was significantly shorter than CA3 pyramidal cell spike durations. Under conditions of environmental stability, granule cell place fields were stable for at least several days. Following occasional maze rotations relative to the (somewhat impoverished) visual stimuli of the recording room, granule cell place fields were maintained relative to the distal spatial cues; however, frequent rotations of the maze sometimes resulted in a shift in the reference frame to the maze itself. These observations indicate that granule cells of the fascia dentata provide their CA3 targets with a high degree of spatial information, in the form of a sparsely coded, distributed representation.},

  abstract = {Single-electrode depth profiles of the hippocampal EEG were made in urethane-anesthetized rats and rats trained in an alternating running/drinking task. Current source density (CSD) was computed from the voltage as a function of depth. A problem inherent to AC-coupled profiles was eliminated by incorporating sustained potential components of the EEG. ‘AC’ profiles force phasic current sinks to alternate with current sources at each lamina, changing the magnitude and even the sign of the computed membrane current. It was possible to include DC potentials in the profiles from anesthetized rats by using glass micropipettes for recording. A method of ‘subtracting’ profiles of the non-theta EEG from theta profiles was developed as an approach to including sustained potentials in recordings from freely-moving animals implanted with platinum electrodes. ‘DC’ profiles are superior to ‘AC’ profiles for analysis of EEG activity because ‘DC’-CSD values can be considered correct in sign and more closely represent the actual membrane current magnitudes. Since hippocampal inputs are laminated, CSD analysis leads to straightforward predictions of the afferents involved. Theta-related activity in afferents from entorhinal neurons, hippocampal interneurons and ipsi- and contralateral hippocampal pyramids all appear to contribute to sources and sinks in CA1 and the dentate area. The largest theta-related generator was a sink at the fissure, having both phasic and tonic components. This sink may reflect activity in afferents from the lateral entorhinal cortex. The phase of the dentate mid-molecular sink suggests that medial entorhinal afferents drive the theta-related granule and pyramidal cell firing. The sustained components may be simply due to different average rates of firing during theta rhythm than during non-theta EEG in afferents whose firing rates are also phasically modulated.},

  abstract = {Computational modeling suggests the function of hippocampal theta rhythm may be separation of encoding and retrieval dynamics (Hasselmo and Wyble, Soc. Neur. Ab. 26: 596.5), which requires that: 1.) for an effective encoding phase, LTP of EPSPs in stratum radiatum (s. rad) of region CA1 should be strongest at the time of weakest transmission in s. rad (peak of the local theta wave), which corresponds to the time of strongest entorhinal input, 2.) for effective behavior, relevant sensory input should arrive at the time of the peak of the EEG in s. rad, while behavioral response should be generated at the trough. We performed experiments testing these requirements. Previous work in hippocampal slices (Huerta and Lisman, 1993) and in anesthetized animals (Holscher et al., 1997) show that EPSPs can be potentiated or depotentiated by stimulating on the peak or trough of the local theta wave, respectively. We examined LTP induction in the awake behaving rat and showed that LTP can be induced (mean EPSP increase for slope=19.9\% +/- 1.4; amplitude=19.4\% +/- 2.0; n=4) by delivery of three high frequency bursts (HFB) at the peaks of local theta activity, while delivery of the same frequency and amplitude HFB at the troughs of local theta results in decreased EPSPUs (mean decrease for slope=21.3\% +/- 4.1; amplitude=17.5\% +/- 4.2; n=4).
In separate experiments, we have analyzed the phase relationship of theta rhythm to behavioral variables in a conditional operant task. Results suggest that phase locking of the time of stimulus occurs most strongly during the period that response accuracy first approaches asymptotic levels.},

Much of this experimental interest has been stimulated by suggestions that the mnemonic functions of the hippocampus may depend upon thetarelated neuronal activity. Inputs from the medial septal nuclei to the hippocampus were shown to be essential for the theta rhythm in the 1950s, but the role of these basal forebrain projections has not been clearly defined. Four models of the septo-hippocampal connections involved in theta rhythm production are reviewed as the precise roles of these projections are discussed. In our final, consolidated model both cholinergic and GABAergic septal projection cells fire in rhythmic bursts that entrain hippocampal interneurons. The resulting rhythmic inhibition of hippocampal projection cells, together with their excitatory interconnections, generates at least one component of the theta rhythm.},

Repetitive stimulation of septo-hippocampal fibres caused a maintained decrease in the frequency of spontaneous IPSPs recorded from CA3 pyramidal cells in the presence of antagonists of excitatory amino acid receptors and of muscarine receptors. 3. In records made from pyramidal cells with CsCl-filled electrodes, IPSPs were examined at potentials both more positive and more negative than their reversal potential. Single septal stimuli hyperpolarized pyramidal cells when IPSPs were depolarizing events and depolarized them when IPSPs were hyperpolarizing. The GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin abolished the effects of septal stimulation. 4. Activation of septal afferents initiated an IPSP in hippocampal inhibitory cells but not in pyramidal cells. Septal IPSPs had similar kinetics to those initiated by local hippocampal stimulation and could suppress inhibitory cell discharge. 5. In pyramidal cells recorded with potassium acetate-filled electrodes, septal stimuli initiated a depolarization that increased with the driving force for Cl- and that could cause firing. 6. Rhythmic stimulation of septo-hippocampal fibres at 5 Hz initiated, in the hippocampus, a maintained out-of-phase oscillation of pyramidal cell discharge and inhibitory cell firing, as detected by the occurrence of spontaneous IPSPs. 7. These results suggest that GABAergic septo-hippocampal afferents selectively inhibit hippocampal inhibitory cells and so disinhibit pyramidal cells. This disinhibition could contribute to the transmission of the theta rhythm from the septum to the hippocampus.},

  abstract = {Seven cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) performed a series of tasks designed to assess their visual memory and their ability to identify visual stimuli. Preoperatively they were trained and tested in delayed and simultaneous matching-to-sample, both with a large stimulus set and with a small stimulus set; there were ∼500 million possible stimuli in the large set, which effectively means that stimuli were trial-unique with this set, while in the small set there were only four stimuli, which appeared repeatedly in every session of training with the small set. Three of the monkeys then had the cortex within and adjacent to the rhinal sulcus removed bilaterally, while the other four served as an unoperated control group. Postoperatively, the animals with ablation of the rhinal cortex showed severe impairment in delayed matching-to-sample with the large set. With the large set they were also impaired, however, in matching-to-sample with no delay between sample and test (0 s delay) and in simultaneous matching-to-sample, in which the sample and the two choice patterns were simultaneously present for inspection. The impairment in simultaneous matching-to-sample was particularly clear when the task was made more difficult by reducing the physical discriminability of the trial-unique stimuli. With the small set of four stimuli, the animals with rhinal cortex ablation were not significantly impaired in overall performance level in delayed matching-to-sample, though their level was on average below that of the normal control animals. The stimulus set was then further restricted, so that there were now only two stimuli used throughout; in this condition, the animals with rhinal cortex ablation performed delayed matching-to-sample without any suggestion of impairment, showing indistinguishable performance levels from those of the control animals over a range of forgetting intervals. Subsequently, the animals were trained in trial-unique non-matching-to-sample with 0 s delay, which required reversal of the matching-to-sample rule they had previously learned; animals with rhinal cortex ablation showed a clear impairment in this rule-reversal learning. The final experimental task was a concurrent discrimination learning task in which 20 pairs of stimuli were presented once per session; the animals with rhinal cortex ablation learned more slowly than the control animals on average, but the difference between the groups did not attain statistical significance. Overall, this pattern of deficits and of preserved abilities is clearly inconsistent with the idea that rhinal cortex ablation produces an impairment in all forms of visual recognition memory, and only in visual recognition memory. Instead, the present results indicate a general impairment in the capacity for knowledge about visual stimuli.},

To begin to understand the contribution of entorhinal cells to different forms of memory, responses of entorhinal cells were recorded as monkeys performed either an object or place memory task. The object memory task was a variation of delayed matching to sample. A sample picture was presented at the start of the trial, followed by a variable sequence of zero to four test pictures, ending with a repetition of the sample (i.e., a match). The place memory task was a variation of delayed matching to place. In this task, a cue stimulus was presented at a variable sequence of one to four “places” on a computer screen, ending with a repetition of one of the previously shown places (i.e., a match). For both tasks, the animals were rewarded for releasing a bar to the match. To solve these tasks, the monkey must 1) discriminate the stimuli, 2) maintain a memory of the appropriate stimuli during the course of the trial, and 3) evaluate whether a test stimulus matches previously presented stimuli. The responses of entorhinal cortex neurons were consistent with a role in all three of these processes in both tasks. We found that 47\% and 55\% of the visually responsive entorhinal cells responded selectively to the different objects or places presented during the object or place task, respectively. Similar to previous findings in prefrontal but not perirhinal cortex on the object task, some entorhinal cells had sample-specific delay activity that was maintained throughout all of the delay intervals in the sequence. For the place task, some cells had location-specific maintained activity in the delay immediately following a specific cue location. In addition, 59\% and 22\% of the visually responsive cells recorded during the object and place task, respectively, responded differently to the test stimuli according to whether they were matching or nonmatching to the stimuli held in memory. Responses of some cells were enhanced to matching stimuli, whereas others were suppressed. This suppression or enhancement typically occurred well before the animals' behavioral response, suggesting that this information could be used to perform the task. These results indicate that entorhinal cells receive sensory information about both objects and spatial locations and that their activity carries information about objects and locations held in short-term memory.},

soon after the offset of stimulus presentation10-18. These
results led to the question of whether any of these neurons could serve
the memory of complex objects. We report here a group of shape-selective
neurons in an anterior ventral part of the temporal cortex of monkeys
that exhibited sustained activity during the delay period of a visual
short-term memory task. The activity was highly selective for the
pictorial information to be memorized and was independent of the
physical attributes such as size, orientation, colour or position of the
object. These observations show that the delay activity represents the
short-term memory of the categorized percept of a picture.},

  abstract = {Inferior temporal (IT) cortex of primates is known to play an important role in visual memory. Previous studies of IT neurons during performance of working memory tasks have found modulation of responses when a current stimulus matched an item in memory; however, this effect was lost if other stimuli intervened in the retention interval. To examine how IT cortex retains memories while new stimuli are activating the cells, we recorded from IT neurons while monkeys performed a delayed matching-to-sample task, with multiple intervening items between the sample and matching test stimulus. About half of the cells responded differently to a test stimulus if it matched the sample, and this difference was maintained following intervening stimuli. For most of the affected cells, the responses to matching stimuli were suppressed; however, for a few cells the opposite effect was seen. Temporal contiguity alone could not explain the results, as there was no modulation of responses when a stimulus on one trial was repeated on the next trial. Thus, an active reset mechanism appears to restrict the memory comparison to just the stimuli presented within a trial. The suppressive effects appear to be generated within or before IT cortex since the suppression of response to matching stimuli began almost immediately with the onset of the visual response. The memory of the sample stimulus affected not only the responses to matching stimuli but also those to nonmatching stimuli. There was suggestive evidence that the more similar a nonmatching stimulus to the sample, the more the response was suppressed. About a quarter of the cells showed stimulus- selective activity in the delay interval following the sample. However, this activity appeared to be eliminated by intervening stimuli. Thus, it is unlikely that delay-interval activity in IT contributed to the performance of this particular version of delayed matching to sample. To determine how much information about the match-nonmatch status of the stimulus was conveyed by individual neurons, we analyzed the responses with discriminant analysis. The responses of an individual IT neuron could be used to classify a stimulus as matching or nonmatching on about 60\% of the trials. To achieve the same performance as the animal would require averaging the responses of a minimum of 25 IT neurons. There was no evidence that mnemonic information was carried by temporal variations in the spike trains. By contrast, there was a modest amount of temporal variation in sensory responses to different visual stimuli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Most physiological studies of this pathway involve recording from hippocampal slices. We have used both single- and double-label 2-deoxyglucose autoradiographic methods to image the pattern of activation in the hippocampal formation of 14 rhesus monkeys performing cognitive tasks, varying in content (spatial or nonspatial), process (working memory or associative memory), and mode of response (oculomotor or manual). These studies revealed a highly differentiated pattern of metabolic activation throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampal formation that was common to all behavioral conditions examined. This pattern consisted of intense activation of the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of CA1 and the subiculum, contrasting with barely detectable activity in CA3 and modest activation in the dentate gyrus, which did not include its molecular layer. These findings indicate a remarkable invariance in hippocampal activation under conditions of varied content, varied process, and varied mode of response and an heretofore-unappreciated preferential engagement of the direct rather than the trisynaptic pathway during performance of a wide range of behavioral tasks.},

  abstract = {Visual short-term memory in humans and animals is frequently assessed using delayed matching to sample (DMTS) and delayed nonmatching to sample (DNMTS) tasks across variable delay intervals. Although these tasks depend on certain common mechanisms, there are behavioral differences between them, and neuroimaging provides a means of assessing explicitly whether this is underpinned by differences at a neural level. Findings of delay-dependent deficits, after lesions in humans and animals, suggest that the neural implementation of these tasks may also critically depend on the delay interval. In this study we determined whether there were differential neural responses associated with DMTS and DNMTS tasks at two different delay intervals using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Ten healthy volunteers were studied under four test conditions: DMTS and DNMTS at 5 and 15 sec delay. The main effect of DMTS compared with DNMTS across both delay intervals was associated with significant activation in bilateral head of caudate and medial orbitofrontal cortex. By contrast, DNMTS compared with DMTS was associated with significant activation in mediodorsal thalamus, bilateral lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and left premotor cortex. The main effect of short compared with long delay, across both tasks, was associated with significantly greater activity in occipital and parietal cortices. By contrast, long compared with short delay was associated with significantly greater activity in temporal and ventrolateral frontal cortices. We conclude that DMTS and DNMTS are not equivalent and furthermore that the precise neural implementation of these tasks is a dynamic function of delay interval.},

The goal of this study was to examine in humans how sustained activity in the parahippocampal gyrus may underlie long-term encoding as well as active maintenance of novel information. The relationship between long-term encoding and active maintenance of novel information during brief memory delays was studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans performing a delayed matching-to-sample (DMS) task and a post-scan subsequent recognition memory task of items encountered during DMS task performance. Multiple regression analyses revealed fMRI activity in parahippocampal structures associated with the active maintenance of trial-unique visual information during a brief memory delay. In addition to a role in active maintenance, we found that the subsequent memory for the sample stimuli as measured by the post-scan subsequent recognition memory task correlated with activity in the parahippocampal gyrus during the delay period. The results provide direct evidence that encoding mechanisms are engaged during brief memory delays when novel information is actively maintained. The relationship between active maintenance during the delay period and long-term subsequent memory is consistent with current theoretical models and experimental data that suggest that long-term encoding is enhanced by sustained parahippocampal activity.},

We assessed visual discrimination in amnesic cases to reveal that while selective hippocampal damaged patients could discriminate faces, objects, abstract art and colour, they were significantly poorer in discriminating spatial scenes. By contrast, patients with MTL damage, including perirhinal cortex, were significantly impaired in discriminating scenes, faces, and to a lesser extent objects, with relatively intact discrimination of art and colour. These novel observations imply that the human MTL subserves both perceptual and mnemonic functions, with the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex playing distinct roles in spatial and object discrimination, respectively.},

In this article, we review recent findings from anatomical, physiological and ablation studies in monkeys, and discuss related findings obtained in humans, in an attempt to identify not only the cognitive functions of the perirhinal cortex, but also the implications of these findings for theoretical views concerning the organization of memory.},

  abstract = {Forced-choice tests of recognition have become the favoured behavioural method for the assessment of models of amnesia in nonhuman primates, yet the profile of deficits shown by human amnesic subjects remains uncertain. The present study explored the performance of 12 amnesic subjects on two delayed matching-to-sample tasks. Experiment 1, which used retention delays of between 2 and 60 sec, confirmed that amnesia impairs such tasks, even when there is only one item to be remembered. The results also highlighted the need to match levels of performance before the effects of delay can be interpreted. In Experiment 2 care was taken to eliminate ceiling effects and to match the subjects at the shortest delay (3 sec). This was achieved by giving the control subjects harder versions of the same task. The amnesic subjects still showed a faster rate of forgetting for abstract patterns, indicating that this is a genuine feature of amnesia. In contrast, the amnesic subjects' performance on a spatial matching-to-sample task was not differentially affected by delays of up to 40 sec. There was no evidence that the amnesic subjects were disproportionately impaired on this spatial task, nor could the different aetiological groups be distinguished by their patterns of DMS performance.},

A double dissociation is reported between deficits of pattern recognition memory and spatial recognition memory which were observed in the two posterior groups and frontal lobe patients, respectively. In addition, both the temporal lobe and amygdalo-hippocampectomy patients were also impaired on a delayed matching-to-sample paradigm whilst frontal lobe patients performed at an equivalent level to controls. Finally, whilst the impaired performance of the three groups was indistinguishable on a test of paired-associate learning, quite different patterns of deficit were observed on a test of spatial working memory. These results are discussed with reference to recent suggestions that visual recognition memory is mediated by a neural system which includes, as major components, the inferotemporal cortex, the medial temporal lobe structures and particular sectors of the frontal lobe, and are compared to previous findings from patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and dementia of the Alzheimer type.},

However, it has not been clear whether its contribution to performance is mainly perceptual, or mainly mnemonic, or whether the perirhinal cortex contributes to both perception and memory. We determined the effects of medial temporal lobe damage that includes complete damage to the perirhinal cortex in two amnesic patients by assessing recognition memory for complex visual stimuli across delays from 0 to 40 s. These patients, as well as six other amnesic patients with damage limited to the hippocampal formation or diencephalic structures, exhibited intact recognition memory at delays of 0-2 s and a delay-dependent memory impairment at delays of 6 s and longer. Additionally, the patients with damage to the perirhinal cortex performed worse than the other amnesic patients at delays of 25 s and longer. The findings suggest that the perirhinal cortex is not important for visual perception or immediate memory. In this respect, the findings for perirhinal cortex resemble the findings for other medial temporal lobe structures, including the hippocampus.},

To address this question a group of amnesic patients were tested on a 14-choice forced-choice visual item recognition test which included a “simultaneous” condition in which the sample remained visible during the matching decision and a zero second delay. Eacott, Gaffan and Murray (1994) have reported an impairment in simultaneous matching-to-sample following perirhinal damage in monkeys. In our amnesic patients, a deficit was found only after filled delays of 10 seconds or longer and this was also the case for a subgroup of patients whose damage included the perirhinal cortex. The second question, which arose from the model of Aggleton and Brown (1999), was whether performance on the DMS task would remain intact following selective damage to the hippocampus. We tested a patient with bilateral damage to the hippocampus on the 14-choice DMS task and found that her performance was not significantly impaired at delays of up to 30 seconds.},

In comparison with a group of normal subjects the postencephalitic group were impaired on the more difficult concurrent discrimination problems.

This book provides accessible coverage of four key areas of recent advance, including research on functional imaging, electrophysiological and lesion studies, and developments from the computational modelling approach.The first section reviews functional imaging studies in humans, with particular emphasis on how imaging methods have clarified the cortical areas involved in memory formation and retrieval. The second section describes electrophysiological and lesion research in monkeys, where lesion and disconnection studies are rapidly adding to our knowledge of both information processing and modulatory aspects of memory formation. In the third section, electrophysiological and lesion studies in rats are reviewed allowing for a detailed study of the role of novelty and exploration in memory formation. The final section reviews current research in computational modelling which has allowed the development of new theoretical and experimental approaches to the study of memory encoding and retrieval.This volume draws together the current developments in each field, allowing the synthesis of ideas and providing converging evidence from a range of sources. It will be a useful resource for both advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students of psychology, as well as researchers in the field and anyone with an interest in cognitive neuroscience.},

In addition, neuroimaging findings have highlighted the role of prefrontal regions in the formation and retrieval of memories for events, or episodic long-term memory (LTM), but it remains unclear whether these regions are distinct from those that support WM. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify patterns of prefrontal activity associated with encoding and recognition during WM and LTM tasks performed by the same subjects. Results showed that the same bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal regions (at or near Brodmann’s Areas {[}BA{]} 6, 44, 45, and 47) and dorsolateral prefrontal regions (BA 9/46) were engaged during encoding and recognition within the context of WM and LTM tasks. In addition, a region situated in the left anterior middle frontal gyrus (BA 10/46) was engaged during the recognition phases of the WM and LTM tasks. These results support the view that the same prefrontal regions implement reflective processes that support both WM and LTM.},

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were recorded as 8 individuals (aged 18–25 yrs) viewed indoor and outdoor novel or highly familiar images and performed a 2-back memory task. Results show that performance of the working memory task with novel complex pictures resulted in greater signal change within medial temporal lobe structures than did familiar complex pictures. The working memory task with highly familiar stimuli resulted in greater prefrontal activation. In a subsequent target-matching task, Ss identified a single target presented in blocks of novel or familiar stimuli. Results show evidence of hippocampal and parahippocampal recruitment in the target-matching task with familiar stimuli. It is concluded that the medial temporal lobe is recruited for the short-term maintenance of information that has no prior representation in the brain, whereas the prefrontal cortex is important for monitoring familiar stimuli that have a high degree of interference. Prefrontal regions may be important for the monitoring and matching of familiar stimuli having a high potential for interference, whereas medial temporal regions may become proportionally more important for matching and maintaining novel stimuli.},

  abstract = {The activity of individual pyramidal cells in the CA1 and CA3 subfields of the rodent hippocampus exhibits a remarkable selectivity for specific locations and orientations of the rat within spatially-extended environments. These cells exhibit high rates of activity when the animal is present within restricted regions of space, referred to as place fields, and are exremely quiet when it is elsewhere. Although this phenomenon has been well studied in the CA fields of the hippocampus, relatively little is known about the spatial and temporal firing characteristics either of the entorhinal cortical inputs to the hippocampus, or of the subicular recipients of the output of hippocampal place cells. We report here on a comparison of spatial and temporal discharge characteristics among entorhinal cortex, CA3 and CA1, and the subiculum. CA3 complex spike cells were significantly more spatially specific than their CA1 counterparts. Neither entorhinal cortex nor subiculum exhibited the highly localized patterns of spatial firing observed in the CA fields. In addition, average discharge rates in these areas were substantially higher. However, particularly in subiculum, there was evidence for spatially consistent, but dispersed, firing in some cells, suggestive of the convergence of a number of CA1 place cells. The patterns observed are not consistent with the hypothesis that spatial selectivity is progressively refined at the various levels of hippocampal processing. Rather, hippocampal output appears to be expressed as a much more highly distributed spatial code than activity within the hippocampus proper. We suggest that the sparse coding used within the hippocampus itself represents a mechanism for increasing the storage capacity of a network whose function is to form associations rapidly.},

  abstract = {Hippocampal “place cells” fire when a freely moving rat is in a given location. The firing of these cells is controlled by visual and nonvisual environmental cues. The effects of darkness on the firing of place cells was studied using the task of Muller et al. (1987), in which rats were trained to chase randomly scattered food pellets in a cylindrical drum with a white cue-card attached to the wall. The position of the rats was tracked via an infrared LED on the headstage with a video system linked to computer. Two experimental protocols were used: in the first, lights were turned off after the rat had already been placed in the chamber; in the second, the rat was placed in the darkened chamber. The dark segments produced by these 2 methods were identical with respect to light and other cues but differed with respect to the rat's experience. The firing patterns of 24 of 28 cells were unaffected by darkness when it was preceded by a light period. In contrast, the firing patterns of 14 of 22 cells changed dramatically when the rats were put into the darkened chamber. Furthermore, the majority of cells that changed their firing pattern in initial darkness maintained that change when the lights were turned on. These results show that place cells can fire differently in identical cue situations and that the best predictor of firing pattern is a combination of current cues and the rat's recent experience. The results are discussed in terms of mnemonic properties of hippocampal cells and “remapping” of place cell representations.},

The effects of excitatory amino acids and some antagonists applied by ionophoresis to stratum radiatum in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices were examined on the locally recorded field e.p.s.p. evoked by stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural projection. 2. L-glutamate, L-aspartate and the more potent and selective excitatory amino acids quisqualate, kainate and N-methyl-DL-aspartate (NMA) depressed the e.p.s.p., presumably through depolarization and/or a change in membrane conductance. 3. The depression induced by kainate considerably outlasted the period of ejection whereas NMA depressions were rapidly reversible and were often followed by a potentiation of the e.p.s.p. In higher doses NMA also depressed the presynaptic fibre volley. The possible involvement of these effects in neurotoxicity and synaptic plasticity is raised. 4. The selective NMA antagonist, DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV) applied in doses which abolished responses to NMA, had no effect on the e.p.s.p. but prevented long term potentiation (l.t.p.) of synaptic transmission evoked by high frequency stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway. Other antagonists which had little or no effect on normal synaptic transmission included D-alpha-aminoadipate (DAA), the optical isomers of 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (APB) and L-glutamate diethylester (GDEE). 5. In contrast, gamma-D-glutamylglycine (DGG), applied in amounts which affected quisqualate and kainate actions as well as those of NMA, was an effective synaptic antagonist whilst having no effect on the presynaptic fibre volley. 6. These results indicate that the synaptic receptor in the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway may be of the kainate or quisqualate type. Although NMA receptors do not appear to be involved in normal synaptic transmission in this pathway they may play a role in synaptic plasticity. The interaction of L-glutamate and L-aspartate with these receptors is discussed.},

  abstract = {Connectionist networks in which information is stored in weights on connections among simple processing units have attracted considerable interest in cognitive science. Much of the interest centers around two characteristics of these networks. First, the weights on connections between units need not be prewired by the model builder but rather may be established through training in which items to be learned are presented repeatedly to the network and the connection weights are adjusted in small increments according to a learning algorithm. Second, the networks may represent information in a distributed fashion. This chapter discusses the catastrophic interference in connectionist networks. Distributed representations established through the application of learning algorithms have several properties that are claimed to be desirable from the standpoint of modeling human cognition. These properties include content-addressable memory and so-called automatic generalization in which a network trained on a set of items responds correctly to other untrained items within the same domain. New learning may interfere catastrophically with old learning when networks are trained sequentially. The analysis of the causes of interference implies that at least some interference will occur whenever new learning may alter weights involved in representing old learning, and the simulation results demonstrate only that interference is catastrophic in some specific networks.},

  abstract = {Miller (1956) summarized evidence that people can remember about seven chunks in short-term memory (STM) tasks. However, that number was meant more as a rough estimate and a rhetorical device than as a real capacity limit. Others have since suggested that there is a more precise capacity limit, but that it is only three to five chunks. The present target article brings together a wide variety of data on capacity limits suggesting that the smaller capacity limit is real. Capacity limits will be useful in analyses of information processing only if the boundary conditions for observing them can be carefully described. Four basic conditions in which chunks can be identified and capacity limits can accordingly be observed are: (1) when information overload limits chunks to individual stimulus items, (2) when other steps are taken specifically to block the recoding of stimulus items into larger chunks, (3) in performance discontinuities caused by the capacity limit, and (4) in various indirect effects of the capacity limit. Under these conditions, rehearsal and long-term memory cannot be used to combine stimulus items into chunks of an unknown size; nor can storage mechanisms that are not capacity-limited, such as sensory memory, allow the capacity-limited storage mechanism to be refilled during recall. A single, central capacity limit averaging about four chunks is implicated along with other, noncapacity-limited sources. The pure STM capacity limit expressed in chunks is distinguished from compound STM limits obtained when the number of separately held chunks is unclear. Reasons why pure capacity estimates fall within a narrow range are discussed and a capacity limit for the focus of attention is proposed.},

  abstract = {Synaptic transmission is a dynamic process. Postsynaptic responses wax and wane as presynaptic activity evolves. This prominent characteristic of chemical synaptic transmission is a crucial determinant of the response properties of synapses and, in turn, of the stimulus properties selected by neural networks and of the patterns of activity generated by those networks. This review focuses on synaptic changes that result from prior activity in the synapse under study, and is restricted to short-term effects that last for at most a few minutes. Forms of synaptic enhancement, such as facilitation, augmentation, and post-tetanic potentiation, are usually attributed to effects of a residual elevation in presynaptic {[}Ca2+{]}i, acting on one or more molecular targets that appear to be distinct from the secretory trigger responsible for fast exocytosis and phasic release of transmitter to single action potentials. We discuss the evidence for this hypothesis, and the origins of the different kinetic phases of synaptic enhancement, as well as the interpretation of statistical changes in transmitter release and roles played by other factors such as alterations in presynaptic Ca2+ influx or postsynaptic levels of {[}Ca2+{]}i. Synaptic depression dominates enhancement at many synapses. Depression is usually attributed to depletion of some pool of readily releasable vesicles, and various forms of the depletion model are discussed. Depression can also arise from feedback activation of presynaptic receptors and from postsynaptic processes such as receptor desensitization. In addition, glial-neuronal interactions can contribute to short-term synaptic plasticity. Finally, we summarize the recent literature on putative molecular players in synaptic plasticity and the effects of genetic manipulations and other modulatory influences.},

The properties of these entities and events, however, are represented in many different regions of the brain that are widely separated. The degree of neural parcellation is even greater when we consider that the perception of most entities and events also requires a motor interaction on the part of the perceiver (such as eye movements and hand movements) and often includes a recordable modification of the perceiver's somatic state. The question of how the brain achieves integration starting with the bits and pieces it has to work with, is the binding problem. Here we propose a new solution for this problem, at the level of neural systems that integrate functional regions of the telencephalon.},

Disruptions in source monitoring (e.g., from confabulation, amnesia, and aging) and the brain regions that are involved are also considered, and source monitoring within a general memory architecture is discussed. It is argued that source monitoring is based on qualities of experience resulting from combinations of perceptual and reflective processes, usually requires relatively differentiated phenomenal experience, and involves attributions varying in deliberateness. These judgments evaluate information according to flexible criteria and are subject to error and disruption. Furthermore, diencephalic and temporal regions may play different roles in source monitoring than do frontal regions of the brain.},

  abstract = {Gamma oscillations are thought to transiently link distributed cell assemblies that are processing related information, a function that is probably important for network processes such as perception, attentional selection and memory. This 'binding' mechanism requires that spatially distributed cells fire together with millisecond range precision; however, it is not clear how such coordinated timing is achieved given that the frequency of gamma oscillations varies substantially across space and time, from 25 to almost 150 Hz. Here we show that gamma oscillations in the CA1 area of the hippocampus split into distinct fast and slow frequency components that differentially couple CA1 to inputs from the medial entorhinal cortex, an area that provides information about the animal's current position, and CA3, a hippocampal subfield essential for storage of such information. Fast gamma oscillations in CA1 were synchronized with fast gamma in medial entorhinal cortex, and slow gamma oscillations in CA1 were coherent with slow gamma in CA3. Significant proportions of cells in medial entorhinal cortex and CA3 were phase-locked to fast and slow CA1 gamma waves, respectively. The two types of gamma occurred at different phases of the CA1 theta rhythm and mostly on different theta cycles. These results point to routeing of information as a possible function of gamma frequency variations in the brain and provide a mechanism for temporal segregation of potentially interfering information from different sources.},

Neural Networks, 15, 689–707{]} suggested that the theta rhythm allows the hippocampal formation to alternate rapidly between conditions that promote memory encoding (strong synaptic input from entorhinal cortex to areas CA3 and CA1) and conditions that promote memory retrieval (strong synaptic input from CA3 to CA1). That model predicted that the preferred theta phase of CA1 spiking should differ for information being encoded versus information being retrieved. In the present study, the spiking activity of CA1 pyramidal cells was recorded while rats performed either an odor-cued delayed nonmatch-to-sample recognition memory test or an object recognition memory task based on the animal’s spontaneous preference for novelty. In the test period of both tasks, the preferred theta phase exhibited by CA1 pyramidal cells differed between moments when the rat inspected repeated (match) and non-repeated (nonmatch) items. Also in the present study, additional modeling work extended the previous model to address the mean phase of CA1 spiking associated with stimuli inducing varying levels of retrieval relative to encoding, ranging from novel nonmatch stimuli with no retrieval to highly familiar repeated stimuli with extensive retrieval. The modeling results obtained here demonstrated that the experimentally observed phase differences are consistent with different levels of CA3 synaptic input to CA1 during recognition of repeated items.},

In humans, oscillatory amplitude has been shown to correlate with memory; however, the role of oscillatory phase in human memory is unknown. We recorded intracranial electroencephalogram from human cortical and hippocampal areas while subjects performed a short-term recognition memory task. On each trial, a series of four list items was presented followed by a memory probe. We found agreement across trials of the phase of oscillations in the 7- to 16-Hz range after randomly timed stimulus events, evidence that these events either caused a phase shift in the underlying oscillation or initiated a new oscillation. Phase locking in this frequency range was not generally associated with increased poststimulus power, suggesting that stimulus events reset the phase of ongoing oscillations. Different stimulus classes selectively modulated this phase reset effect, with topographically distinct sets of recording sites exhibiting preferential reset to either probe items or to list items. These findings implicate the reset of brain oscillations in human working memory.},

Source monitoring and the special case of reality monitoring have become very popular as paradigms to assess memory deficits in various subject populations. The paradigm provides categorical data that satisfy product-multinomial constraints, and this lends it nicely to multinomial modeling with processing-tree structures as described in D. M. Riefer and W. H. Batchelder (see record 1988-31527-001). The models developed herein are based on ideas from high-threshold signal-detection models, and they involve item-detection parameters, source-identification parameters, and various parameters reflecting guessing biases. The purpose of the models is to provide separate, theoretically based measures of old-item detection and source discrimination. The models may strengthen traditional analyses that are based on ad hoc statistics, as well as avoid flawed interpretations that the traditional analyses may produce. The usefulness of the models is revealed by analyzing published data sets from the areas of reality monitoring and bilingual memory.},

With a 3 (distractor similarity) × 3 (source similarity) factorial design, the effect of difficulty of item detection and source discrimination on corresponding model parameters was examined. Only the source-monitoring model that is based on a two-high-threshold model of item recognition provides an accurate analysis of the data.

  abstract = {Examines the role that response strategies play in a memory paradigm known as source monitoring. It is argued that several different response biases can interact to confound the interpretation of source-monitoring data. This problem is illustrated with 2 empirical examples, taken from the psychological literature, which examine the role of source monitoring in the generation effect and the picture superiority effect. To resolve this problem, a new multinomial model for source monitoring is presented that is capable of separately measuring memory factors from response-bias factors. The model, when applied to the results of 2 new experiments, results in a clearer picture of which source-monitoring variables are instrumental in the generation effect and picture superiority effect.},

The term is commonly used to refer to two types of processes: synaptic consolidation, which is accomplished within the first minutes to hours after learning and occurs in all memory systems studied so far; and system consolidation, which takes much longer, and in which memories that are initially dependent upon the hippocampus undergo reorganization and may become hippocampal-independent. The textbook account of consolidation is that for any item in memory, consolidation starts and ends just once. Recently, a heated debate has been revitalized on whether this is indeed the case, or, alternatively, whether memories become labile and must undergo some form of renewed consolidation every time they are activated. This debate focuses attention on fundamental issues concerning the nature of the memory trace, its maturation, persistence, retrievability, and modifiability.},

The main feature of the additive-factor method is the search for non-interacting effects of experimental factors on mean RT. The method is applied to several binary-classification experiments, where it leads to a four-stage model, and to an identification experiment, where it distinguishes two stages. The sets of stages inferred from both these and other data are shown to carry substantive implications. It is demonstrated that stage-durations may be additive without being stochastically independent, a result that is relevant to the formulation of mathematical models of RT.},

Two experiments investigated the relation between implicit serial learning and ideas about learning forwarded by Hebb and others who used his method. The experiments showed that implicit serial learning occurs even when the repeating sequence is intermixed with randomly generated sequences instead of being repeated continuously, that the organization of the sequence into regularly or irregularly grouped subsequences determines the extent of learning, and that the repetition effect observed does not depend on subjects' ability to recognize the repetition.},

  abstract = {Many models of serial recall assume a chaining mechanism whereby each item associatively evokes the next in sequence. Chaining predicts that, when sequences comprise alternating confusable and non-confusable items, confusable items should increase the probability of errors in recall of following non-confusable items. Two experiments using visual presentation and one using vocalized presentation test this prediction and demonstrate that: (1) more errors occur in recall of confusable than alternated non-confusable items, revealing a “sawtooth” in serial position curves; (2) the presence of confusable items often has no influence on recall of the non-confusable items; and (3) the confusability of items does not affect the type of errors that follow them. These results are inconsistent with the chaining hypothesis. Further analysis of errors shows that most transpositions occur over short distances (the locality constraint), confusable items tend to interchange (the similarity constraint), and repeated responses are rare and far apart (the repetition constraint). The complete pattern of errors presents problems for most current models of serial recall, whether or not they employ chaining. An alternative model is described that is consistent with these constraints and that simulates the detailed pattern of errors observed.},

A highly significant correlation was found between letters which confused in the listening test, and letters which confused in recall. The role of neurological noise in recall is discussed in relation to these results. It is further argued that information theory is inadequate to explain the memory span, since the nature of the stimulus set, which can be defined quantitatively, as well as the information per item, is likely to be a determining factor.},

Repeatedly presenting the stimulus but not its testing did not increase recall, but recall did increase when both presentation and testing were repeated. Recall was also improved by precues that informed Ss in advance which sequence was to be recalled. The perturbation model of W. K. Estes (1972) and of C. L. Lee and Estes (see record 1982-02748-001) was able to account for the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the results by making an explicit distinction between 2 types of rehearsal: the reactivation process, which corresponds to a passive, automatic rehearsal process; and an active, conscious rehearsal process that crystallizes the memory structure and makes perturbations less likely.

  abstract = {This study attempts to discover why items which are similar in sound are hard to recall in a short-term memory situation. The input, storage, and retrieval stages of the memory system are examined separately. Experiments I, II and III use a modification of the Peterson and Peterson technique to plot short-term forgetting curves for sequences of acoustically similar and control words. If acoustically similar sequences are stored less efficiently, they should be forgotten more rapidly. All three experiments show a parallel rate of forgetting for acoustically similar and control sequences, suggesting that the acoustic similarity effect does not occur during storage. Two input hypotheses are then examined, one involving a simple sensory trace, the other an overloading of a system which must both discriminate and memorize at the same time. Both predict that short-term memory for spoken word sequences should deteriorate when the level of background noise is increased. Subjects performed both a listening test and a memory test in which they attempted to recall sequences of five words. Noise impaired performance on the listening test but had no significant effect on retention, thus supporting neither of the input hypotheses. The final experiments studied two retrieval hypotheses. The first of these, Wickelgren's phonemic-associative hypotheses attributes the acoustic similarity effect to inter-item associations. It predicts that, when sequences comprising a mixture of similar and dissimilar items are recalled, errors should follow acoustically similar items. The second hypothesis attributes the effect to the overloading of retrieval cues which consequently do not discriminate adequately among available responses. It predicts maximum error rate on, not following, similar items. Two experiments were performed, one involving recall of visually presented letter sequences, the other of auditorily presented word sequences. Both showed a marked tendency for errors to coincide with acoustically similar items, as the second hypothesis would predict. It is suggested that the acoustic similarity effect occurs at retrieval and is due to the overloading of retrieval cues. Now at the Laboratory of Experimental Psychology, University of Sussex.},

  abstract = {Studied recognition and recall of digit series as a function of segmental groupings imposed on the series either by the location of pauses or in the naming of successive numerical groups, e.g., 1735 was read to S as "seventeen, thirty-five." Experiments show that alteration of group structure of the same underlying digit string severely degraded memorial recognition of its repetition and that the normal improvement in immediate recall with repetition was annihilated by changing groupings at each presentation. The "reallocation" hypothesis was proposed as a summary of the results, whereby group structure affects perceptual coding, which determines "where" the trace of the event is stored. This was contrasted to a "bin" hypothesis for serial recall. Experiments to differentiate these involved recall of strings in which only a subsequence or portion recurred. As predicted by the reallocation hypothesis, recall of the recurrent constant chunk improved only when it was located at the beginning of the string. (20 ref.)},

  abstract = {It has been shown that short-term memory (STM) for word sequences is grossly impaired when acoustically similar words are used, but is relatively unaffected by semantic similarity. This study tests the hypothesis that long-term memory (LTM) will be similarly affected. In Experiment I subjects attempted to learn one of four lists of 10 words. The lists comprised either acoustically or semantically similar words (A and C) or control words of equal frequency (B and D). Lists were learned for four trials, after which subjects spent 20 min. on a task involving immediate memory for digits. They were then asked to recall the word list. The acoustically similar list was learned relatively slowly, but unlike the other three lists showed no forgetting. Experiment II showed that this latter paradox can be explained by assuming the learning score to depend on both LTM and STM, whereas the subsequent retest depends only on LTM. Experiment III repeats Experiment I but attempts to minimize the effects of STM during learning by interposing a task to prevent rehearsal between the presentation and testing of the word sequences. Unlike STM, LTM proved to be impaired by semantic similarity but not by acoustic similarity. It is concluded that STM and LTM employ different coding systems.},

  abstract = {Four experiments with 60 undergraduates found long-term serial position effects in the delayed free recall of word pairs whose presentations were separated by distractor activity. The long-term primacy effect was reduced by manipulations discouraging cumulative rehearsal of the first few pairs, such as increasing the difficulty of the distractor task in the interpair interval (Exp I) and incidental learning instructions (Exp II). The long-term recency effect was not changed by either of these manipulations. It was also unaffected by the difficulty of the distractor task in the retention interval. Results are inconsistent with a short-term store interpretation of the long-term recency effect. Recency was positively correlated with the ratio of the length of the interpair interval to the length of the retention interval. Based on these results, it was hypothesized that the primacy effect was due to extra processing given to the first few items, and recency was due to a retrieval strategy that relied on contextual–temporal cues available at the recall test. This hypothesis was tested and its predictions confirmed in Exp IV. (14 ref)},

Kahana (see record 1996-93836-009) documented this effect and showed that this tendency, which the authors refer to as the lag recency effect, is well described by a variant of the search of associative memory (SAM) model (J. G. W. Raaijmakers \& R. M. Shiffrin, 1980, 1981). In 2 experiments, participants performed immediate, delayed, and continuous distractor free recall under conditions designed to minimize rehearsal. The lag recency effect, previously observed in immediate free recall, was also observed in delayed and continuous distractor free recall. Although two-store memory models, such as SAM, readily account for the end-of-list recency effect in immediate free recall, and its attenuation in delayed free recall, these models fail to account for the long-term recency effect. By means of analytic simulations, the authors show that both the end of list recency effect and the lag recency effect, across all distractor conditions, can be explained by a single-store model in which context, retrieved with each recalled item, serves as a cue for subsequent recalls.},

  abstract = {I present a new method for analyzing associative processes in free recall. While previous research has emphasized the prominence of semantic organization, the present method illustrates the importance of association by contiguity. This is done by examining conditional response probabilities in the output sequence. For a given item recalled, I examine the probability and latency that it follows an item from a nearby or distant input position. These conditional probabilities and latencies, plotted as a function of the lag between studied items, reveal several regularities about output order in free recall. First, subjects tend to recall items more often and more rapidly from adjacent input positions than from remote input positions. Second, subjects are about twice as likely to recall adjacent pairs in the forward than in the backward direction and are significantly faster in doing so. These effects are observed at all positions in the output sequence. The asymmetry effect is theoretically significant because, in cued recall, nearly symmetric retrieval is found at all serial positions (Kahana, 1995; Murdock, 1962). An attempt is made to fit the search of associative memory model (Raaijmakers \& Shiffrin, 1980, 1981) with and without symmetric interitem associations to these data. Other models of free recall are also discussed.},

An approximately linear relationship was discovered to hold over ratios ranging from 1:12 to 12:1 (Experiment 1), and also for constant ratios ranging from 1:1 to 12:12 (Experiments 2 and 3). However, in contrast to a “true” ratio rule, recency systematically decreased with increases in absolute duration, despite a constant IPI to RI ratio. A new distinctiveness model is proposed that accurately predicts the reported empirical relationships. The model incorporates a precise definition of stimulus distinctiveness, based on the dimensional distinctiveness model, and includes a specific mechanism to account for how the distinctiveness of each item arises, based on the perturbation model.},

We then recorded the activity of neurons from the lateral prefrontal cortex during task performance and found that most neurons had activity that depended on the identity of both objects while a minority reflected just one object. Further, the activity driven by a particular combination of objects was not a simple addition of the activity elicited by individual objects. Instead, the representation of the first object was altered by the addition of the second object to memory, and the form of this change was not systematically predictable. These results indicate that multiple objects are not stored in separate groups of prefrontal neurons. Rather, they are represented by a single population of neurons in a complex fashion. We also found that the strength of the memory trace associated with each object decayed over time, leading to a relatively stronger representation of more recently seen objects. This is a potential mechanism for representing the temporal order of objects.},

Associative recognition decisions were accompanied by more “remember” responses and less “know” responses than item recognition decisions. Overall recognition performance and the proportion of remember responses declined at similar rates for item and associative information. The pattern of results for item recognition was consistent with Donaldson’s (1996) single-factor signal detection model of remember/ know responses, as comparisons based onA′ between overall item recognition and remember item recognition showed no significant differences. For associative recognition, however,A′ for remember responses was reliably greater than for overall recognition. The results show that recollection plays a significant role in associative recognition.},

This work addresses this shortcoming by providing a way in which working memory (WM) and episodic memory may be included in the reinforcement learning framework, then simulating the successful acquisition and performance of six behavioral tasks, drawn from or inspired by the rat experimental literature, that require WM or episodic memory for correct performance. With no delay imposed during the tasks, simulations with WM can solve all of the tasks at above the chance level. When a delay is imposed, simulations with both episodic memory and WM can solve all of the tasks except a disambiguation of odor sequences task. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

This abnormal serial position curve is traditionally taken as evidence for a distinction between different memory processes, with amnesia being associated with selectively impaired long-term memory. However recent accounts of normal serial position curves have emphasized the importance of rehearsal processes in giving rise to primacy effects and have suggested that a single temporal distinctiveness mechanism can account for both primacy and recency effects when rehearsal is considered. Here we explore the pattern of strategic rehearsal in a patient with very severe amnesia. When the patient’s rehearsal pattern is taken into account, a temporal distinctiveness model can account for the serial position curve in both amnesic and control free recall. The results are taken as consistent with temporal distinctiveness models of free recall, and they motivate an emphasis on rehearsal patterns in understanding amnesic deficits in free recall.},

  abstract = {A primary objective in developing a neural prosthesis is to replace neural circuitry in the brain that no longer functions appropriately. Such a goal requires artificial reconstruction of neuron-to-neuron connections in a way that can be recognized by the remaining normal circuitry, and that promotes appropriate interaction. In this study, the application of a specially designed neural prosthesis using a multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear model is demonstrated by using trains of electrical stimulation pulses to substitute for MIMO model derived ensemble firing patterns. Ensembles of CA3 and CA1 hippocampal neurons, recorded from rats performing a delayed-nonmatch-to-sample (DNMS) memory task, exhibited successful encoding of trial-specific sample lever information in the form of different spatiotemporal firing patterns. MIMO patterns, identified online and in real-time, were employed within a closed-loop behavioral paradigm. Results showed that the model was able to predict successful performance on the same trial. Also, MIMO model-derived patterns, delivered as electrical stimulation to the same electrodes, improved performance under normal testing conditions and, more importantly, were capable of recovering performance when delivered to animals with ensemble hippocampal activity compromised by pharmacologic blockade of synaptic transmission. These integrated experimental-modeling studies show for the first time that, with sufficient information about the neural coding of memories, a neural prosthesis capable of real-time diagnosis and manipulation of the encoding process can restore and even enhance cognitive, mnemonic processes.},

Subjects received 3 tests of nonverbal memory: forward block span, immediate and delayed recall of the Wechsler Memory Scale drawings, and immediate and delayed recognition of abstract designs. Compared with the normal control group, the patient groups displayed different patterns of sparing and loss of the two components of memory: in PD, only STM was impaired; in medial temporal lobe amnesia, only LTM was impaired; and in AD, STM and LTM were both impaired. The contrasting patterns of sparing and loss of STM and LTM in PD and global amnesia were present for both recognition and recall. These results provide evidence that STM and LTM are dissociable processes and are served by separate neurological systems: STM depends upon intact corticostriatal systems, whereas LTM depends upon intact medial temporal lobe systems.},

Because of their radically different scopes and emphases, however, comparing different models and theories and understanding how they relate to one another has been a difficult task. This work offers a much-needed forum for systematically comparing and contrasting existing models of working memory. It does so by asking each contributor to address the same comprehensive set of important theoretical questions on working memory. The answers to these questions elucidate the emerging general consensus on the nature of working memory among different theorists and clarify incompatible theoretical claims that must be resolved in future research. As such, this volume serves not only as a milestone that documents the state of the art in the field, but also as a theoretical guidebook that will promote new lines of research and more precise and comprehensive models of working memory.},
