  abstract = {The construction of compartmental models of neurons involves tuning a set of parameters to make the model neuron behave as realistically as possible. While the parameter space of single-compartment models or other simple models can be exhaustively searched, the introduction of dendritic geometry causes the number of parameters to balloon. As parameter tuning is a daunting and time-consuming task when performed manually, reliable methods for automatically optimizing compartmental models are desperately needed, as only optimized models can capture the behavior of real neurons. Here we present a three-step strategy to automatically build reduced models of layer 5 pyramidal neurons that closely reproduce experimental data. First, we reduce the pattern of dendritic branches of a detailed model to a set of equivalent primary dendrites. Second, the ion channel densities are estimated using a multi-objective optimization strategy to fit the voltage trace recorded under two conditions – with and without the apical dendrite occluded by pinching. Finally, we tune dendritic calcium channel parameters to model the initiation of dendritic calcium spikes and the coupling between soma and dendrite. More generally, this new method can be applied to construct families of models of different neuron types, with applications ranging from the study of information processing in single neurons to realistic simulations of large-scale network dynamics.},

  abstract = {The medial temporal lobe (MTL) has been studied extensively at all levels of analysis, yet its function remains unclear. Theory regarding the cognitive function of the MTL has centered along 3 themes. Different authors have emphasized the role of the MTL in episodic recall, spatial navigation, or relational memory. Starting with the temporal context model (M. W. Howard \& M. J. Kahana, 2002a), a distributed memory model that has been applied to benchmark data from episodic recall tasks, the authors propose that the entorhinal cortex supports a gradually changing representation of temporal context and the hippocampus proper enables retrieval of these contextual states. Simulation studies show this hypothesis explains the firing of place cells in the entorhinal cortex and the behavioral effects of hippocampal lesion in relational memory tasks. These results constitute a first step toward a unified computational theory of MTL function that integrates neurophysiological, neuropsychological, and cognitive findings.},

Lists of words were presented to Ss who were then tested with an immediate free recall test prior to drug administration. Following injection delayed free recall and recognition tests were given. Subsequently two sets of lists were presented separately and tested in the same fashion. Two of the lists in the last set were composed of words falling into distinct categories. Memory was additionally analyzed by testing immediate recall of digit sequences and employing a visual recognition test. Subjective moods were evaluated with a rating questionnaire. Both diazepam and scopolamine impaired memory functions although the action of the latter drug was more pronounced and prolonged. The deficit appeared to be in the storage process leaving retrieval processes unaffected. Scopolamine in addition interfered with organizational processes. Subjectively, scopolamine also produced a larger sedative effect than diazepam.},

Here, we present an algorithm that optimizes the computational graph of the Nengo neural network simulator, allowing simulations to run more quickly on commodity hardware. This is achieved by merging identical operations into single operations and restructuring the accessed data in larger blocks of sequential memory. In this way, a time speed-up of up to 6.8 is obtained. While this does not beat the specialized OpenCL implementation of Nengo, this optimization is available on any platform that can run Python. In contrast, the OpenCL implementation supports fewer platforms and can be difficult to install.},

However, the organizing principles of memory systems remain unclear. Emerging experiment results show that memories are represented by population of neurons and organized in a categorical and hierarchical manner. In this work, we describe a hierarchically organized memory (HOM) model using spiking neurons, in which temporal population codes are considered as the neural representation of information and spike-timing-based learning methods are employed to train the network. The results have demonstrated that memory coding units are formed into neural cliques, and information are stored in the form of associative memory within gamma cycles. Moreover, temporally separated patterns can be linked and compressed via enhanced connections among neural groups forming episodic memory. Our model provides a computational interpretation of memory organization at a system level.},

We then propose a two-layer spiking independent accumulator (IA) model, and compare its performance against the LCA network on a variety of WTA benchmarks.

Moreover, performance on the word-completion test declined at a normal rate reaching chance after about 120 min. The word-completion test resembled the cued-recall test in that the initial letters of previously presented words were given as cues. It differed from cued recall only in the instructions, which directed subjects away from the memory aspects of the test and asked them to complete each three-letter cue with the first word that came to mind. The present results offer an explanation of conflicting findings that have been obtained with amnesic patients on tests of the cued-recall type. The results are considered in terms of a process (activation or procedural learning), which is spared in amnesia and not dependent on the integrity of the damaged brain regions.},

  abstract = {Hippocampal place cells in the rat are so named because they fire predominantly within circumscribed regions of the environment. This study describes the positional firing properties of cells afferent to hippocampal place cells, in superficial layers of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). MEC cells in these layers project to the hippocampus via the perforant path and, along with lateral entorhinal cells, are the sole route by which cortical information reaches the hippocampus. MEC cells were recorded from rats while they retrieved pellets in simple geometric enclosures. The behavioral task as well as procedures for data collection and analysis were the same used in previous studies on hippocampal place cells (e.g., Muller et al., 1987) in order to facilitate the direct comparison between hippocampal and entorhinal cells. The firing patterns of MEC cells show pronounced locational variations reminiscent of hippocampal firing fields, but with a lower signal-to-noise ratio. While noisy, MEC firing patterns are stationary in time as evidenced by their reproducibility, and the improvement in spatial signal with long-duration recordings. Furthermore, MEC firing patterns are not due to variations in the rat's behavior. Taken together, these data show that the positional firing variations in MEC cells are due to the location-specificity of MEC cells. These and additional data lead us to conclude that location-specific information exists prior to the hippocampus. MEC cells are similar to hippocampal place cells in that their firing can be controlled by the rotation of a visual cue (a white card attached to the wall), but is not disrupted by removing the cue. An important difference between hippocampal and entorhinal cells was seen when the shape of the recording chamber was changed. In the transition from a cylinder to an equal-area square of similar appearance, MEC firing patterns topologically transformed (or "stretched") while those of hippocampal place cells changed to an unpredictable pattern. We conclude that the positional firing of MEC cells is more "sensory bound" than hippocampal cells, and that the ability to discriminate different environments, while present in the hippocampus, is not yet present in its input from MEC.},

Dual-store models assume that retrieval from late positions is dependent on short-term memory (STM), whereas retrieval from early positions is dependent on long-term memory (LTM). Single-store models, however, assume that retrieval processes for early and late items are similar, but that early items are more difficult to discriminate than late items. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine this question. Ten young adults were scanned while they recognized items from early or late serial positions. Recognition of early items uniquely activated brain areas traditionally associated with LTM, namely, regions within the hippocampal memory system. None of these areas was activated for retrieval of late items. These results indicate differential use of LTM retrieval processes, and therefore support dual-store models over single-store models.},

  abstract = {Lesions of the entorhinal cortex in humans, monkeys, and rats impair memory for a variety of kinds of information, including memory for objects and places. To begin to understand the contribution of entorhinal cells to different forms of memory, responses of entorhinal cells were recorded as monkeys performed either an object or place memory task. The object memory task was a variation of delayed matching to sample. A sample picture was presented at the start of the trial, followed by a variable sequence of zero to four test pictures, ending with a repetition of the sample (i.e., a match). The place memory task was a variation of delayed matching to place. In this task, a cue stimulus was presented at a variable sequence of one to four "places" on a computer screen, ending with a repetition of one of the previously shown places (i.e., a match). For both tasks, the animals were rewarded for releasing a bar to the match. To solve these tasks, the monkey must 1) discriminate the stimuli, 2) maintain a memory of the appropriate stimuli during the course of the trial, and 3) evaluate whether a test stimulus matches previously presented stimuli. The responses of entorhinal cortex neurons were consistent with a role in all three of these processes in both tasks. We found that 47\% and 55\% of the visually responsive entorhinal cells responded selectively to the different objects or places presented during the object or place task, respectively. Similar to previous findings in prefrontal but not perirhinal cortex on the object task, some entorhinal cells had sample-specific delay activity that was maintained throughout all of the delay intervals in the sequence. For the place task, some cells had location-specific maintained activity in the delay immediately following a specific cue location. In addition, 59\% and 22\% of the visually responsive cells recorded during the object and place task, respectively, responded differently to the test stimuli according to whether they were matching or non-matching to the stimuli held in memory. Responses of some cells were enhanced to matching stimuli, whereas others were suppressed. This suppression or enhancement typically occurred well before the animals' behavioral response, suggesting that this information could be used to perform the task. These results indicate that entorhinal cells receive sensory information about both objects and spatial locations and that their activity carries information about objects and locations held in short-term memory.},

  abstract = {The activity of 378 single neurons was recorded from areas of the parahippocampal region (PHR), including the perirhinal and lateral entorhinal cortex, as well as the subiculum, in rats performing an odor-guided delayed nonmatching-to-sample task. Nearly every neuron fired in association with some trial event, and every identifiable trial event or behavior was encoded by neuronal activity in the PHR. The greatest proportion of cells was active during odor sampling, and for many cells, activity during this period was odor selective. In addition, odor memory coding was reflected in two general ways. First, a substantial proportion of cells showed odor-selective activity throughout or at the end of the memory delay period. Second, odor-responsive cells showed odor-selective enhancement or suppression of activity during stimulus repetition in the recognition phase of the task. These data, combined with evidence that the PHR is critical for maintaining odor memories in animals performing the same task, indicate that this cortical region mediates the encoding of specific memory cues, maintains stimulus representations, and supports specific match-nonmatch judgments critical to recognition memory. By contrast, hippocampal neurons do not demonstrate evoked or maintained stimulus-specific codings, and hippocampal damage results in little if any decrement in performance on this task. Thus it becomes increasingly clear that the parahippocampal cortex can support recognition memory independent of the distinct memory functions of the hippocampus itself.},

This kind of memory involves associations among items or events that can be accessed flexibly to guide memory expression in various and even new situations. In animals, there has been controversy about whether the hippocampus is specialized for spatial memory or whether it mediates a general memory function, as it does in humans. To address this issue we trained normal rats and rats with hippocampal damage on non-spatial stimulus-stimulus associations, then probed the nature of their memory representations. We report here that normal rats demonstrated two forms of flexible memory expression, transitivity, the ability to judge inferentially across stimulus pairs that share a common element, and symmetry, the ability to associate paired elements presented in the reverse of training order. Rats with neurotoxic damage limited to the hippocampus demonstrated neither form of flexible expression, indicating that non-spatial declarative processing depends specifically on the hippocampus in animals as it does in humans.},

  volume = {72},
  issn = {0031-9384},
  abstract = {Previous research has provided convincing evidence that rats can learn to anticipate the individual elements of a stimulus series consisting of differing amounts of food reinforcement. Rats prepared with lesions of the dorsal striatum or hippocampus were initially trained to acquire a three-element series consisting of 21 sucrose pellets, followed by 0- and 7-pellets (Noyes standard), respectively. During the initial 30 days of training, the animals were run in two adjacent runways; the runways included either of a white, rough runway or a black, smooth runway as additional series cues. Thus, training included both floor (S-R) cues and the series (inter-item memory) cues. Anticipation was defined as faster running on the 21- than on the 7-pellet element and 7- than on the 0-pellet element. While anticipation developed more slowly in the lesion groups than in the control group, all animals eventually demonstrated the ability to track the elements of the series. Reversal of the floor cues disrupted tracking in the hippocampus-lesioned and control animals; dorsal striatum-lesioned rats were also affected but did continue tracking. As a final test, shifting the order of the series produced a marked disruption in performance in the dorsal striatum-lesioned rats but not in the hippocampus-lesioned or control rats. The results are consistent with the proposal that integrated neural mediation is required for anticipation, with a system that includes the dorsal striatum necessary for the promotion of a reinforced approach response and a system that includes the hippocampus necessary for associating and temporarily maintaining an internal record of the different elements of the stimulus series.},

Previous studies have identified the striatum as a critical component in the neural circuitry of reward-related learning. It remains unclear, however, under what task conditions, and to what extent, the striatum is modulated by punishment during an instrumental learning task. Using high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a reward- and punishment-based probabilistic associative learning task, we observed activity in the ventral putamen for stimuli learned via reward regardless of whether participants were correct or incorrect (i.e., outcome). In contrast, activity in the dorsal caudate was modulated by trials that received feedback—either correct reward or incorrect punishment trials. We also identified an anterior/posterior dissociation reflecting reward and punishment prediction error estimates. Additionally, differences in patterns of activity that correlated with the amount of training were identified along the anterior/posterior axis of the striatum. We suggest that unique subregions of the striatum—separated along both a dorsal/ventral and anterior/posterior axis— differentially participate in the learning of associations through reward and punishment.},

Recent proposals have argued for a functional division of the striatum along these lines, attributing, for example, learning to one region and performance to another. Here, we consider empirical data from human and animal studies, as well as theoretical notions from both the psychological and computational literatures, and conclude that striatal sub-regions instead differ most clearly in terms of the associations being encoded in each region.},

The paradigm consisted of 2 cues that predicted each of 3 targets with varying probabilities. Simultaneously, we varied the frequency with which each target was presented throughout the task, independent of cue associations. Subjects had shorter response latencies to frequently occurring and highly associated target stimuli and longer response latencies to infrequent target stimuli, indicating learning. Imaging results showed increased caudate activity to infrequent relative to frequent targets and increased hippocampal activity to infrequent relative to frequent cue– target associations.

  issn = {1529-2401},
  abstract = {Long-term potentiation (LTP) at the basal-dendritic synapses of CA1 pyramidal cells was induced by a single 200 Hz stimulation train (0.5-1 sec duration) in freely behaving rats during one of four behavioral states: awake-immobility (IMM), walking, slow-wave sleep (SWS), and rapid eye movement sleep (REM). Field EPSPs generated by basal-dendritic excitation of CA1 were recorded before and up to 1 d after the tetanus. After a tetanus during any behavioral state, basal-dendritic LTP was $>$170\% of the baseline for the first hour after the tetanus and decayed to approximately 120\% 1 d after. LTP induced during walking was significantly larger than that induced during IMM, SWS, or REM, which had similar LTP magnitudes. To test the hypothesis that septohippocampal cholinergic activity enhanced LTP during walking as compared with IMM, rats were either pretreated with muscarinic cholinergic antagonist scopolamine or injected with IgG192-saporin in the medial septum to selectively lesion cholinergic septohippocampal neurons. Pretreatment with scopolamine decreased the LTP induced during walking but did not affect that induced during IMM, such that the difference between the LTP induced during walking and IMM was abolished after scopolamine. Rats injected with IgG192-saporin showed no difference in the LTP induced during walking and IMM, and scopolamine did not reduce the LTP during walking. In contrast, sham-lesion rats showed larger LTP induced during walking than IMM, and the LTP induced during walking was attenuated by scopolamine. This is the first demonstration of an enhancement of hippocampal LTP by physiologically activated cholinergic inputs.},

In anesthetized rats, physostigmine (0.01 mg/kg, i.v.) enhanced at a late phase the long-term potentiation induced by tetanic stimulation (15 Hz, 15 s, 7.5 times the threshold for population spike) of the perforant path, while scopolamine (1.0 mg/kg) suppressed it at an early phase. The two drugs did not affect the population spike itself. The time course of the long-term potentiation under the treatment of physostigmine was similar to that induced by stronger tetanic stimulation (10 times the threshold). In hippocampal slices, physostigmine (10(-6)M) showed a tendency to enhance the long-term potentiation induced by tetanic stimulation (15 Hz, 15 s, 5 times the threshold) of the stratum radiatum, with an increase of the population spike itself. Scopolamine (10(-5)M) markedly suppressed the long-term potentiation with a decrease of the population spike itself. From these results, it is suggested that cholinergic modification by physostigmine or scopolamine affects the long-term potentiation phenomenon in the hippocampus under the in vivo and in vitro conditions.},

  abstract = {Maneuvering safely through the environment is central to survival of almost all species. The ability to do this depends on learning and remembering locations. This capacity is encoded in the brain by two systems: one using cues outside the organism (distal cues), allocentric navigation, and one using self-movement, internal cues and nearby proximal cues, egocentric navigation. Allocentric navigation involves the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and surrounding structures; in humans this system encodes allocentric, semantic, and episodic memory. This form of memory is assessed in laboratory animals in many ways, but the dominant form of assessment is the Morris water maze (MWM). Egocentric navigation involves the dorsal striatum and connected structures; in humans this system encodes routes and integrated paths and, when overlearned, becomes procedural memory. In this article, several allocentric assessment methods for rodents are reviewed and compared with the MWM. MWM advantages (little training required, no food deprivation, ease of testing, rapid and reliable learning, insensitivity to differences in body weight and appetite, absence of nonperformers, control methods for proximal cue learning, and performance effects) and disadvantages (concern about stress, perhaps not as sensitive for working memory) are discussed. Evidence-based design improvements and testing methods are reviewed for both rats and mice. Experimental factors that apply generally to spatial navigation and to MWM specifically are considered. It is concluded that, on balance, the MWM has more advantages than disadvantages and compares favorably with other allocentric navigation tasks.},

The “Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma” has been used widely as a model for the evolution of cooperation in societies. Axelrod’s computer tournaments and the extensive simulations of evolution by Nowak and Sigmund and others have shown that natural selection can favor cooperative strategies in the Prisoner’s Dilemma. Rigorous empirical tests, however, lag behind the progress made by theorists. Clear predictions differ depending on the players’ capacity to remember previous rounds of the game. To test whether humans use the kind of cooperative strategies predicted, we asked students to play the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma game either continuously or interrupted after each round by a secondary memory task (i.e., playing the game “Memory”) that constrained the students’ working-memory capacity. When playing without interruption, most students used “Pavlovian” strategies, as predicted, for greater memory capacity, and the rest used “generous tit-for-tat” strategies. The proportion of generous tit-for-tat strategies increased when games of Memory interfered with the subjects’ working memory, as predicted. Students who continued to use complex Pavlovian strategies were less successful in the Memory game, but more successful in the Prisoner’s Dilemma, which indicates a trade-off in memory capacity for the two tasks. Our results suggest that the set of strategies predicted by game theorists approximates human reality.},

  abstract = {Despite a strong intuitive and theoretical tradition linking autobiographical memory and sense of self, there are few coherent, testable models that exemplify how these constructs relate. Without any clear theoretical starting point, research efforts have been fragmented, with many different fields of psychology operating in relative isolation, using different methodological approaches and a confusing array of self-related terminology. We attempt to bridge the widening gap between theory and research by proposing a novel framework for sense of self and memory. This simple model delineates sense of self along 2 dimensions: the subjective versus objective and the present versus temporally extended aspects of sense of self. The 4 resulting components of sense of self are argued to relate to autobiographical memory in important, but very different, ways. Subjective sense of self provides a crucial precondition for episodic memory, which in turn is a prerequisite for phenomenological continuity. Autobiographical memory, and particularly its semanticized forms, are important for the formation and maintenance of a mental representation of the objective self in the present moment and across time. This model does not represent a new theoretical direction for the study of sense of self and memory; to the contrary, it is deeply grounded in the theoretical work of the past few decades. Its novelty is that it translates this theoretical groundwork into a form that is readily accessible for researchers. We review evidence for our model and suggest ways that it may provide a roadmap for future research efforts.},

  abstract = {In two experiments, we investigated the hypothesis that a strengthening of position-item associations underlies the improvement seen in performance on an immediate serial recall task, for a list that is surreptitiously repeated every third trial. Having established a strong effect of repetition, performance was tested on transfer lists in which half the items held the same position as in the repeated list (S-items) and the remainder moved (D-items). In Experiment 1, S-items showed a small advantage in order errors over control and D-items. A second experiment tested whether a design feature in Experiment 1 underlay this advantage. When the experimental design was better controlled, no improvement was shown for either S- or D-items over controls. These data were shown to be inconsistent with the results of computer simulations of a positional model. An alternative model is outlined.},

In addition, we discuss how recent work on the Hebb repetition effect is consistent with the idea that learning in this task is itself a laboratory analogue of the sequence-learning component of phonological word-form learning. In this light, we present a unifying modelling framework that seeks to account for ISR and Hebb repetition effects, while being extensible to word-form learning. Because word-form learning is performed in the service of later word recognition, our modelling framework also subsumes a mechanism for word recognition from continuous speech. Simulations of a computational implementation of the modelling framework are presented and are shown to be in accordance with data from the Hebb repetition paradigm.},

  shorttitle = {Brain Regions Underlying Repetition and Auditory-Verbal Short-Term Memory Deficits in Aphasia},
  abstract = {Background: A deficit in the ability to repeat auditory-verbal information is common among individuals with aphasia. The neural basis of this deficit has traditionally been attributed to the disconnection of left posterior and anterior language regions via damage to a white matter pathway, the arcuate fasciculus. However, a number of lesion and imaging studies have called this notion into question. Aims: The goal of this study was to identify the neural correlates of repetition and a related process, auditory-verbal short-term memory (AVSTM). Both repetition and AVSTM involve common elements such as auditory and phonological analysis and translation to speech output processes. Based on previous studies, we predicted that both repetition and AVSTM would be most dependent on posterior language regions in left temporo-parietal cortex. Methods \& Procedures: We tested 84 individuals with left hemisphere lesions due to stroke on an experimental battery of repetition and AVSTM tasks. Participants were tested on word, pseudoword, and number-word repetition, as well as digit and word span tasks. Brain correlates of these processes were identified using a statistical, lesion analysis approach known as voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM). VLSM allows for a voxel-by-voxel analysis of brain areas most critical to performance on a given task, including both grey and white matter regions. Outcomes \& Results: The VLSM analyses showed that left posterior temporo-parietal cortex, not the arcuate fasciculus, was most critical for repetition as well as for AVSTM. The location of maximal foci, defined as the voxels with the highest t values, varied somewhat among measures: Word and pseudoword repetition had maximal foci in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus, on the border with inferior parietal cortex, while word and digit span, as well as number-word repetition, were centred on the border between the middle temporal and superior temporal gyri and the underlying white matter. Conclusions: Findings from the current study show that (1) repetition is most critically mediated by cortical regions in left posterior temporo-parietal cortex; (2) repetition and AVSTM are mediated by partially overlapping networks; and (3) repetition and AVSTM deficits can be observed in different types of aphasia, depending on the site and extent of the brain injury. These data have implications for the prognosis of chronic repetition and AVSTM deficits in individuals with aphasia when lesions involve critical regions in left temporo-parietal cortex.},

  abstract = {Brain imaging studies have suggested a critical role for prefrontal cortex in working memory (WM) tasks that require both maintainenance and manipulation of information over time in delayed-response WM tasks. In the present study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine whether prefrontal areas are activated when only maintenance is required in a delayed-response WM task, without the overt requirement to manipulate the stored information. In two scans, six subjects performed WM tasks in which, on each trial, they (1) encoded 1, 3, or 6 to-be-remembered letters, (2) maintained these letters across a 5-second unfilled delay, and (3) determined whether a single probe letter was or was not part of the memory set. Activation of left caudal inferior frontal gyrus was observed, relative to the 1-letter task, when subjects were required to maintain 3 letters in WM. When subjects were required to maintain 6 letters in WM, additional prefrontal areas, most notably middle and superior frontal gyri, were activated bilaterally. Thus, increasing the amount of to-be-maintained information, without any overt manipulation requirement, resulted in the recruitment of wide-spread frontal-lobe regions. Inferior frontal gyrus activation was left-hemisphere dominant in both the 3- and 6-letter conditions, suggesting that such activation reflected material-specific verbal processes. Activation in middle and superior frontal gyri appeared only in the 6-letter condition and was right-hemisphere dominant, suggesting that such activation reflected material-independent executive processes.},

However, little is known about the fundamental cognitive mechanisms of hippocampal dependent memory or about the nature of hippocampal neural representations that underlie properties of declarative memory. Here, it is proposed that the hippocampus plays a critical role, when distinct personal experiences must be encoded in relation to one another and linked within an organization that supports flexible, inferential memory expression. This set of fundamental cognitive mechanisms is consistent with key properties of declarative memory as observed in humans. Furthermore, emerging evidence from recordings of hippocampal neural activity shows that hippocampal networks encode episodic memories as sequences of events and the places, where they occur. In addition, hippocampal neuronal networks encode events and places that are common across related episodes. This combination of coding properties suggests that the hippocampus contributes to declarative memory by mediating the construction of a "memory space" composed of a network of linked episodic representations.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the spatial distribution and cellular-synaptic generation of hippocampal sharp waves (SPW) in the dorsal hippocampus of the awake rat. Depth analyses of SPWs were performed by stepping the recording electrode in 82.5 μm increments. SPWs were present during slow wave sleep, awake immobility, drinking, grooming and eating (0.01–2/s). The largest negative SPWs were recorded from the middle part of the stratum radiatum of CA1, the stratum lucidum of CA3, the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and from layer I of the subiculum, in that order. The polarity of the SPWs was positive in layers II–IV of the subiculum, in stratum oriens and stratum pyramidale of CA1 and CA3, and in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. The electrical gradients across the null zones of the field SPWs were as large as 8–14 mV/mm. SPWs were associated with population bursts of pyramidal cells and increased discharges of interneurons and granule cells. During the SPW the excitability of granule cells and pyramidal cells to afferent volleys increased considerably. Picrotoxin and atropine and aspiration lesion of the fimbria-fornix increased either the amplitude or the frequency of SPWs. Diazepam and Nembutal could completely abolish SPWs. It is suggested that: (1) hippocampal SPWs are triggered by a population burst of CA3 pyramidal cells as a result of temporary disinhibition from afferent control; and (2) field SPWs represent summed extracellular PSPs of CA1 and subicular pyramidal cells, and dentate granular cells induced by the Schaffer collaterals and the associational fibers of hilar cells, respectively. The relevance of the physiological SPWs to epileptic interictal and long-term potentiation is discussed.},

To address this issue, we studied CFC in local field potential oscillations recorded from the CA3 region of the dorsal hippocampus of rats as they learned to associate items with their spatial context. During the course of learning, the amplitude of the low gamma subband (30–60 Hz) became more strongly modulated by theta phase in CA3, and higher levels of theta–gamma modulation were maintained throughout overtraining sessions. Furthermore, the strength of theta–gamma coupling was directly correlated with the increase in performance accuracy during learning sessions.

  abstract = {OʼKeefe and Recce ([1993] Hippocampus 68:317–330) have observed that the spatially selective firing of pyramidal cells in the CA1 field of the rat hippocampus tends to advance to earlier phases of the electroencephalogram theta rhythm as a rat passes through the place field of a cell. We present here a neural network model based on integrate‐and‐fire neurons that accounts for this effect. In this model, place selectivity in the hippocampus is a consequence of synaptic interactions between pyramidal neurons together with weakly selective external input. The phase shift of neuronal spiking arises in the model as a result of asymmetric spread of activation through the network, caused by asymmetry in the synaptic interactions. Several experimentally observed properties of the phase shift effect follow naturally from the model, including 1) the observation that the first spikes a cell fires appear near the theta phase corresponding to minimal population activity, 2) the overall advance is less than 360°, and 3) the location of the rat within the place field of the cell is the primary correlate of the firing phase, not the time the rat has been in the field. The model makes several predictions concerning the emergence of place fields during the earliest stages of exploration in a novel environment. It also suggests new experiments that could provide further constraints on a possible explanation of the phase precession effect. © 1996 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.},

Recordings from both hippocampal and neocortical depth electrodes were analyzed while six epileptic patients played a virtual taxi-driver game. During the game, the patients alternated between searching for passengers, whose locations were random, and delivering them to stores, whose locations remained constant. In both hippocampus and neocortex, theta increased during virtual movement in all phases of the game. Hippocampal and neocortical theta activity were also significantly correlated with each other, but this correlation did not differ between neocortex and hippocampus and within disparate neocortical electrodes. Our findings demonstrate the existence of movement-related theta oscillations in human hippocampus, and suggest that both cortical and hippocampal oscillations play a role in attention and sensorimotor integration. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {The coordinated activity of hippocampal neurons is reflected by macroscopic patterns, theta and sharp waves (SPW), evident in extracellular field recordings. The importance of these patterns is underscored by the ordered relation of specific neuronal populations to each pattern as well as the relation of each pattern to distinct behavioral states. During awake immobility, consummatory behavior, and slow wave sleep, CA3 and CA1 neurons participate in organized population bursts during SPW. In contrast, during theta-associated exploratory activity, the majority of principle cells are silent. Considerably less is known about the discharge properties of retrohippocampal neurons during theta, and particularly during SPW. These retrohippocampal neurons (entorhinal cortical, parasubicular, presubicular, and subicular) process and transmit information between the neocortex and the hippocampus. The present study examined the activity of these neurons in freely behaving rats during SPW (awake immobility) as well as theta (locomotion and REM sleep). A qualitative distinction between the activity of deep (V-VI) and superficial (II- III) layer retrohippocampal neurons was observed in relation to SPW as compared to theta. Deep layer retrohippocampal neurons exhibited a concurrent increase in activity during hippocampal SPW. In contrast, deep layer neurons were not modulated by the prominent theta oscillations observed throughout the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. On the other hand, superficial layer retrohippocampal neurons were often phase-related to theta oscillations, but were surprisingly indifferent to the SPW-associated population bursting occurring within the deep layers. These findings indicate a concerted discharge of the hippocampal and retrohippocampal cortices during SPW that includes neurons within CA3, CA1, and subiculum as well as neurons in layers V- VI of the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and entorhinal cortex. Further, they suggest a temporal discontinuity in the input/output relations between the hippocampus and retrohippocampal structures. We suggest that SPW-associated population bursts in hippocampal and retrohippocampal cortices exert a powerful depolarizing effect on their postsynaptic neocortical targets and may represent a physiological mechanism for memory trace transfer from the hippocampus to the neocortex.},

  abstract = {Neuroscientists have long criticised deep learning algorithms as incompatible with current knowledge of neurobiology. We explore more biologically plausible versions of deep representation learning, focusing here mostly on unsupervised learning but developing a learning mechanism that could account for supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The starting point is that the basic learning rule believed to govern synaptic weight updates (Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity) arises out of a simple update rule that makes a lot of sense from a machine learning point of view and can be interpreted as gradient descent on some objective function so long as the neuronal dynamics push firing rates towards better values of the objective function (be it supervised, unsupervised, or reward-driven). The second main idea is that this corresponds to a form of the variational EM algorithm, i.e., with approximate rather than exact posteriors, implemented by neural dynamics. Another contribution of this paper is that the gradients required for updating the hidden states in the above variational interpretation can be estimated using an approximation that only requires propagating activations forward and backward, with pairs of layers learning to form a denoising auto-encoder. Finally, we extend the theory about the probabilistic interpretation of auto-encoders to justify improved sampling schemes based on the generative interpretation of denoising auto-encoders, and we validate all these ideas on generative learning tasks.},
