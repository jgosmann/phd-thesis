\chapter{Introduction}

Memory in its different forms is an important aspect of human, but also animal cognition.
For example, it allows animals to return to previously visited water and food locations (TODO refs).
Prior experiences also allow to act more optimally in similar situations or avoid dangerous situations.
In this sense memory allows for adaptation on a faster time scale than genetic selection.
This is especially important in unstable and changing environments.
In humans, memory is also important to form social relationships, a shared culture, and even a functioning society.
Moreover, it contributes to our individual sense of self.
In general, the storage of information over time is a fundamental requirement in many cognitive systems and also from a computational point of view an addressable memory is important as it allows for more compact implementations than a pure state machine (TODO cite Gallistel).

Accordingly, there is a long history of memory research.
The well-known primacy and recency effect (discussed in more detail in TODO) have already been described by TODO Robinson, Brown 1926.
Nevertheless, there are still many open questions.
One important challenge that has to be solved by a memory system is the so-called \emph{stability-plasticity dilemma} (TODO ref Abaraham and A Robins 2005).
On the one hand, there is a need to quickly form new memories, sometimes even with a single exposure known as \emph{one-shot learning}.
On the other hand, such high plasticity can easily lead to overwriting of old memories rendering memory system useless.
TODO refo Buzsaki and others proposed multi-stage memory models where different memory system are in place for different timescales with different levels of plasticity.
However, this still leaves open TODO questions.

It also is a strong indication that different memory systems interact.
Though, it much of experimental research and modeling different memory systems have been treated as isolated.
This simplifies the analysis on a certain level, but to get a general understanding of memory as a whole the results need to integrated at some point.
Furthermore, many models of memory or learning focus on either small scale neural changes without any direct connection to behaviour or on the other extreme of describing behaviour with mathematical equations, but no solid grounding in biological plausibility.
So it is not only important to integrate our understanding of memory systems, but also to bridge the gap from neural mechanisms to behaviour.
This thesis will try to advance our understanding in this direction.

While this will still be comparably rough sketch and still fairly limited in memory systems covered, there are promising long-term prospects from a better understanding of human memory.
Many forms of memory loss are currently untreatable.
However, diseases associated with aging like Alzheimer's significantly impair the function of memory and are getting more common as our life-span increases due to other medical and nutritional advances.
(TODO stroke, hippocampal lesions?)
A better understanding of memory might allow us to devise better treatments or even stop and reverse the memory detoriation.
A potential route to this are memory implants that have already been demonstrated in rats by TODO Berger et all 2011.
For this sort of implant, an understanding of how memories are encoded is at least helpful if not crucial.

These are certainly strong motivators for research into memory, but it is also worthwhile to advance our general understanding of how the human brain works.
A question that has puzzled researchers for a long time and probably still will for a long time to come despite great advances.
An important step in testing our current understanding of the brain was the Spaun model (TODO ref).
A spiking neural network of XX neurons, thus grounded in biology, that can perform 8 different tasks.
Like a real brain it gets sensory input (low resolution black and white symbols) and produces a behavioural motor output with a simulated arm.
The number of tasks it can perform demonstrates that it is not a specialized model for a single task, but can switch between different tasks like a real brain.
Obviously, Spaun is still much simpler (and has much less neurons) like a real brain.
So there is no denying that it is still a long way to a full understanding of the whole brain.
But it incorporates a number of qualitative key aspects.
However, one key aspect is still missing.
While it can perform working memory dependent tasks and has simple reinforcement learning, it is missing a declarative and episodic long-term memory.
The work in this thesis is also a step towards providing Spaun with such a memory by integrating it with a short-term memory component similar to the one used in Spaun.


\section{Behavioural characterization of memory}
Memory is commonly characterized along two orthogonal dimensions:
by timescale and by type of information stored.
On the timescale axis one usually discriminates between short-term memory (STM), and long-term memory or short-term, long-term, and very long-term memory (vLTM).
However, there is no single agreed upon definition which timescales are encompassed in each of these terms.
Sometimes LTM is used to refer to vLTM, while sometimes LTM is in-between STM and vLTM\@.
As a rough orientation STM is usually taken to be on the sub-second timescale, up to a few seconds.
Very long-term memory is on timescales of weeks and up (TODO verify).
LTM, depending on the definition, covers timescales from minutes and up.
Moreover, the term working memory (WM) is often used to refer to active representations that allow direct mental manipulation.

In this thesis, I will use the term STM for timescales in the order of seconds and LTM for longer timescales, but separate from vLTM\@.
Moreover, I will assume STM to be based on neural-activity and thus this definition is somewhat in line with the definition of WM\@.

When classifying memory by type of information, a representation as a tree structure can be helpful.
On the highest level, we have the distinction between implicit and explicit memory.
Implicit memory does not allow for conscious access.
A typical example is procedural or motor memory like how to ride a bike.
Explicit memory allows for conscious access and is further subdivided into declarative and episodic memory.
The declarative memory allows us to store and reproduce facts like the birthday of a friend, whereas the episodic memory provides a recollection of life experiences.

Here, I will focus on declarative memory as this type of memory has been well studied in many memory experiments.


\section{Experimental findings in memory research}
Most memory experiments require the participants to memorize lists of words and recall them afterwards.
The words are typically chosen from the Toronto noun pool and are matched for semantic similarity and occurrence frequency (TODO verify, ref).
Usually an experiment will fall in one of two categories depending on how the subjects are required to recall the list items: in free recall experiments, the subjects are free to recall the items in any order; in serial recall experiments, the subjects are required to recall the items in order.

The hallmark finding in memory research, especially for serial recall experiments, are the primacy and recency effect.
Subjects tend to remember the start of list (primacy) and the end of list (recency) better (TODO fig).
Furthermore, if subjects in a serial recall experiment recall an item at the wrong position, a so-called \emph{transposition}, it is more likely to be an item that was close in the list than an item several positions spaced out.

In free recall experiments, participants usually start out by recalling the last items first.
This can be measured by the probability of first recall (TODO fig).
There is also the tendency, to recall items in forward direction and items close to the last recalled item.
The conditional response probability (CRP) measures this (TODO fig)
It gives the probability of how many items forward or backward (know as the lag) the next recall will jump.

In memory experiments the recall phase can directly follow the study phase, known as an immediate recall experiment, or a delay, potentially with a distractor task, can separate the two, known as delayed recall.
Sometimes a distraction task will be performed in between each list item which is known as continuous distractor recall.

\section{Memory models}
TODO discuss desired properties of models
TODO categorization by conceptual, abstract mathematical, and neural models

\subsection{Conceptual models}
\Textcite{Yntema1963} presented one of the first models of memory.
They conceptualized retrieval as a search process where each item in memory is associated with tags referencing further information.
For example, a time tag would encode the time an item was observed.
The whole description, however, is more based on how a memory system could be implemented on a classical von Neumann computer and does not consider if or how those operations could be neurally implemented.

To date, the most influential conceptual organization of working memory was proposed by \textcite{Baddeley1986}.
He proposed, based on experimental data, separate stores for visual and acoustic information, termed the visuospatial sketchpad and phonological loop respectively.
These are controlled by a central executive.
Furthermore, in \textcite{Baddeley2000} the model was extended with an episodic buffer for the binding of multimodal information and transfer to episodic long-term memory.
The main relevance of the model is that it informs us about the organization of (working) memory by modality; but it does less to elucidate mechanisms.

In general, conceptual models can give a high-level account and they can be evaluated with respect to their qualitative agreement to behavioural data.
However, they cannot provide us with quantitative predictions which makes a more rigorous validation difficult.
They also, do not explain the cognitive mechanisms in detail and an account of the neural implementation is completely out of their reach.


\subsection{Mathematical models}
Some of the weaknesses of conceptual models are addressed by mathematical models.
These models will make quantitative predictions about the behavioural data and describe underlying cognitive mechanisms to a varying degree, but do not provide a neural implementation.
There is a vast amount of such models and not all can be discussed here.
Thus I will focus on the most influential ones.

That list certainly contains the perturbation model for serial order by \textcite{Estes1972}, the free recall model Search of Associative Memory (SAM) by \textcite{Raaijmakers1981}, the recognition memory model Retrieving Effectively from Memory (REM) by \textcite{Shiffrin1997}, and the episodic memory model MINERVA2 by \textcite{Hintzman1988}.
The perturbation model an early attempt to provide a mathematical framework of how remembered item positions can drift over time.
In SAM cues are assembled in a short-term memory to retrieve associations from a long-term associative memory (the search part of the model).
In the REM model error prone copies of feature vectors derived from the study items are stored.
A recognition probe is matched to the stored feature vectors and a likelihood ratio of the match scores being generated by an old vs.\ a new item is calculated.
The MINERVA2 model also uses feature vectors that are stored as traces and can be probed by cues.

All of these models, and most other mathematical model, either assume item-to-item or position-to-item associations.
The primacy model by \textcite{Page1998} is worth noting because it uses a different approach.
In that model items are activated according to a primacy gradient, but the model is agnostic to how this gradient is generated.
This, however, also leaves that aspect underspecified.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Enable quantitative predictions, long history, only a subset of most influential ones presented
    \item recognition memory model retrieving effectively from memory (REM) by Shiffrin Steyvers (1997)
    \item free recall model search of associative memory (SAM) by Raaijmakers and Shiffrin (1981)
    \item MINERVA2 episodic memory model by Hintzman (1988)
    \item pertubation model for serial order by Estes (1972).
    \item None of these concerned with biological plausibility. Can they be implemented in neurons and will predictions hold up?
    \item most models assume item-to-item or posititon-to-item association, but primacy model by Page and Norris (1998) uses different approach. Items activated according to a primacy gradient, but agnostic to how that gradient is generated, thus somewhat underspecified?
    \item But some general useful ideas: representation of item as random vector starting with JA Anderson (1973), relation to SPA, potentially implementable with the NEF
    \item Especially influential regarding these sort of models was TODAM2 (Murdock, 1993). Aims to be general theory for item recognition, serial order, and associative memory; fits large body of experimental data.
    \item Neural implementation likely possible (but not attempted) with the NEF\@.
    \item Choo (2010) pointed out a number of problems with such an implementation: dimensionality of vectors increases with items stored, unbounded growth, response generation not part of the model
    \item Another useful idea: randomly drifting context signal to associate items to; first model of this type Estes (1955)
    \item Murdock (1997) extended TODAM2 with context to explain further data.
    \item OSCAR (GDA Brown, Prees and Hulme, 2000) also matches a large body of experimental data. They use multidimensional oscillators instead of randomly drifting context to avoid re-instatement problem by deterministic context.
    \item But how is initial context to start recall re-instantiated?
    \item (grouping structure has to be known in advance for grouping effects)
    \item symmetric CRP is a problem
    \item TCM with context updated by item itself, presented as single-store framework, but not all STM data captured (and they don't even try in initial paper?), see Davelaar 2008 (does CUE capture the data?)
    \item fuzzy temporal memory
    \item Start-End Model (SEM) (Henson, 1998) reproduces relative positional coding within groups (probably only one), not clear how endmarker can be generated (despite suggestions in the paper)
    \item Anderson and Matessa 1997 ACT-R model of serial recall, items are associated with serial position and grouped. Detailed steps of recall, but no neural implementation or specification of how exactly items are stored.
\end{itemize}





CUE\@: neural implementation (biological plausibility), includes recall/reinstantiation of context, (limited neural resources)


Further points (some maybe for conclusion, not introduction?):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Large scale modeling has new challenges.
    \item How do things interact?
    \item How are they coordinated?
    \item Increases to simulation speed (better neural representation, optimizer)
\end{itemize}
