\chapter{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item match multitude of data
    \item delayed CRP not worse the original paper
    \item Robustness against parameter change (picked with few simulation, thus robust)
    \item fuzzy temp memory sensitive to noise and thus no alternative for context signal
    \item basal ganglia involvement
    \item changes with regard to original TCM\@: finite vector dimensionality, not perfectly orthogonal; simpler equations
    \item partially better match than TCM\@?
    \item Role of AML
    \item Things developed on the way of creating large scale model: spaopt, better product, binding operations, wta network
    \item neural position counting
    \item Control is the hard part
    \item Integration with Spaun, use actual distractor task
    \item From math model to spiking neural network model viable and useful (why?)
    \item Consideration of spiking noise, exact implementation of experimental protocol
    \item discuss merits of model in terms of desired properties of models
    \item Explains context reinstantiation
    \item optimizer
    \item giving account of response generation missing from other models
\end{itemize}
